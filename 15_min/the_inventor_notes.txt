she was trained as an engineer

Theranos
- portmanteau of therapy
and diagnosis

# POINT
Associates
============
Bill Clinton
Eric Schmidt from Google
people from AirBnb, Uber
Mark Zuckerberg

Founded the company when she was 19

She claims she never plan to
drop out of Stanford

She raised more than $400M
Company was evaluated at $9B
at one point
- she owned 50%

# POINT
Stanford Research Park
Elizabeth Holmes
Elon Musk 
Mark Zuckerberg
Steve Jobs

moved here biotech
startup to this research park
in 2014

employed 800 people
and was worth over $10B

4 years later, it was worth less
than $0

In the beginning, she very likely
had very good intentions

claimed to be able to run
a series of comrehensive
lab tests from a single drop
of blood taken from a finger
- claimed to have replaced the tubes upon tubes
of blood from traditional blood draws
and replaced it with
the "nanotainer"
# LOOKUP

# POINT
Not only is the idea of replacing the high
number of blood vials of traditional flobotomy
with a tiny vial genuinely revolutionary (if
it were true),
but the idea aleviates the fear of pain
of having to be stuck with a giant needle
for a basic medical test

flobotomy (i.e., the amount of blood
required for accuracy) concepts
haven't changed since the 50s
- has it not changed because
it was perfected back then?
- did the doctors know that that was required?
- what made Holmes believe she could actually
change this?
# POINT
- this aspect of her psyche may be key
in the deliberation

Theranos named their blood testing
machine the Edision
- based off of a quote from Thomas Edison
  - "I have not failed. I've just found
10,000 ways that won't work."
- Holmes stated that she assumed the machine
would fail 10K times before it worked

TE - the Wizard of Menlo Parks
- over 2K patents
- often promised more w/ his products
than was actually delivered

was on the cover of Fortune
and Forbes

Roger Parloff for his Fortune interview
with Holmes claimed that when she spoke
on topics other than diagnostic
testing she was "very, prepossesing, very ingenuous"
she shifted when speaking about other topics
- very firm grasp on all the facts, no question
surprised her, very idealistic when speaking
of the mission

Dec 3, 2014
- most powerful women's conference
- hosted by Fortune

A woman who founded a company in Silicon Valley,
a male dominated space

Quest and LabCorp controlled 80%
of the lab testing market
- Holmes wanted to challenge them
with transparency and cost-cutting
- could do over 1K differnt blood tests
- these companies faced some legal issues
in the past

She slept 4 hours a day
- claimed to be married to Theranos
- was in the office until midnight

wore black clothes
- claimed that deciding what to wear
was one decision not made on Theranos
- a Steve Jobs sentiment

Holmes viewed Jobs as a hero
- wore black turtle necks since 7

Erika Cheung
- lab assistant
- viewed Holmes as a good idol to have

Cheryl Gafner
- receptionist
- noticed that Holmes didn't blink
- viewd Holmes as intense
- noticed that there wasn't a person
between the interviewee and Holmes
  - me, there was not middle man
of new-hires and the CEO of a multi-billion
dollar company?

Dave Philippides
- engineer
- didn't go into great detail
about what they were doing during the interview
- didn't blink
  - compared to other biotech
companies in the bay area
- was told about the 1 drop of blood,
but didn't explain how it works

Douglas Matje
- biochemist
- how did they describe the project?
  - they didn't
- had only a vague idea of what
he was signing up for
- viewed this a par for start-ups
  - they want to keep what they are doing
a secret

Holmes stated secrecy around Theranos
was it not needing to explain
itself to competitive companies

Explained how monthly blood tests could
be a way to view your health as a movie,
each drop a frame
- personalized medicine

put the lab inside the Edison machine
- a difficult task
  - all that plus a centrifuge?
- how do you make these tests dependable?

Holmes best friends in high schools
were books
- Moby Dick, the Iliad, the Odyssey

Dr. Phyllis Gardner, MD
- professor of medicine, Stanford

Holmes filed her first patent while at Stanford
- MEDICAL DEVICE FOR ANALYTE MONITORING AND DRUG
DELIVERY

Holmes came to Gardner w/ an idea for a patch
that could take a sample to test for an infection
and then deliver antibiotics
- Gardner told her that this was impossible
- antibiotics in such small amounts
would not be potent enough to treat the
infection
- felt Holmes wasn't listening
  - but would help her find someone who
might (emphasis) be able to help
  - Channing Robertson, Theranos advisor

Robertson was the head of the
science dept at Stanford
- left his tenured position to
work for Holmes
- viewed Holmes as special

Holmes stated she didn't plan on dropping out
of Stanford, but she wasn't going to classes
anyway so why waste the money?

Dan Ariely
- behavioral economist
- how do you not believe your own bullshit?

Holmes claimed early work was for pharma companies
and applications for the military

Holmes saw the value in remaining a private company
- not have to talk about what they were
doing w/o it being done

Holmes used her story alone as the blueprint
for success
- was able to gather hundreds of millions
in investor dollars
- these investors never looked
at audited financial statements

early investors are guided by their
gut
- Avi Tovenian, former head of software at Apple
- founder of Oracle, larry elison
- Don Lucas, original investor of Oracle

These men gave an air of respect
to the Theranos operation
- no record to go on

Holmes great grandfather
- was an entreprenuer
great uncle has his name on a hospital
Holmes had medicine
- appeared to have success in her blood

Tim Draper
- knew Holmes when she was a girl
- investor
- was told medicine was in need
of an update and Holmes was the one to do it
- first investor in Tesla, Skype, Hotmail
- invests in vision, opportunity, and person
who he thinks can get it there

Data doesn't sit in the mind of early
values as much as the story does
- stories stoak emotions

Board of Directors
--------------------
George P. Shultz
- Sec of State, Labor, Treasury
Gary Roughead
Henry A. Kissinger
- Former Secretary of State
Sam Nunn
William J. Perry
- former SECDEF
Richard Kovacevich
- former CEO of Wells Fargo
James N. Mattis
- former CENTCOM commander


Holmes wanted to find a board that
was "strategically brilliant"

Tyler Shultz
- research engineer

Holmes was coming to the birthday
parties and XMas's in George Shultz's
family

all of the directors were really impressed
with her

James Mattis described here was having
confidence, integrity, and competence (technological
and scientific), and having focus on human
rights
- was impressed w/ the prospect of
knowing if someone was ill w/in minutes
of a small blood sample

Kissinger described her as having
an ethereal quality

None of the people selected for the board
knew anything about science to a near-expert degree
- they were not great judges of what
was mecically possible
- aligned herself w/ very powerful men of
influence
  - people w/ govt ties, DoD

Holmes danced around the question of getting govt
contracts

Holmes continued to imply that there
were contracts w/ the military, but never gave any
details

In a mock-up of marketing materials,
Theranos invented a quote from Mattis stating
"We were able to take these small machines to
the frontlines on helicopters and planes, test,
get extremely accurate results and begin
stabilization immediately."
- This never happened

Before the DoD would allow these tests to be
ran on servicemembers, the Pentagon
required that they run their own tests against
the machine
- Holmes declined

Holmes had a policy of controlling
Edison presentations and access to
the prototypes

Ken Auletta
- The New Yorker
"The lab is a large, labyrinthine place
bustling with chemists and technicians, and
housing rows of machines, each easy for
a single person to lift, in which the containers
of blood are placed. What exactly happens
in the machines is treated as a state secret,
and Holmes's description of the process was
comically vague.

"A chemistry is performed so that a
chemical reaction occurs and generates
a signal from the chemical interaction
with the sample, which is translated
into a result, which is then reviewed
by certified laboratory personnel."

https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/12/15/blood-simpler

Sunny Balwani
- president and COO
"We are a very conservative company because
we think you should get things done before
you talk about them. That's the culture that
we have created."
- was very close to Holmes, probably
romantically

Holmes and Balwani did not
disclose their relationship
to potential investors

Walgreens had interest in Theranos

mini lab pitched claimed to be
able to run over 200 tests
- wasn't true
- Walgreens signed up, they really
believed it was possible
- Walgreens never examined the Edison

- Edison had trouble regulating
temperature
- there are droplets of blood
and chemical spattering
everywhere
- the machine would freeze up
and someone would have to reach into
this machine with needles
and pathogens everywhere
to try to get it working again
- pieces of the device would fall
of in the middle of the tests
- the centrifuge frequently stopped working

During demos, executives blood would be
drawn and fed into a demo machine
- they would then go do a tour
or have lunch
- engineer would immediately
go in, grab the cartridge from
the Edison and run tests
in an actual blood lab

the 200 blood test claim was actually
less than half
- all those tests requires machinery
- very impractical do fit this into
a desktop machine
- counter to the laws of physics
- requests to make the Edison bigger were
met with comments like "well, maybe you're
not a Silicon Valley person", or "maybe
you don't believe in the vision"

When Holmes and Balwani were told "no, it
can't physically be done", they would find
someone, often younger and less
experienced, who said "sure, I'll give it a try"

Ian Gibbons
- one of the first actual scientists hired
by Theranos
- an expert in blood testing
- Cambridge Ph.D.
- he would look at the data from the
tests and would bring to light
all the problems
- for this he faced retaliation
  - eventually didn't have an office
anymore
  - was involved less and less in decision making
processes

Holmes tried to forbid Gibbons from testifying
in a lawsuit against Theranos in 2013
- if he gave an honest accounting of
the state of the Edison, some of
Theranos's patents might be invalidated
- his stress over facing being honest
in court made him fear losing his job
  - led him to drink heavily
  - eventually took his own life over
the matter
  - didn't know what else he would do
with his life if were fired for being
honest
- Theranos didn't reach out to Rochelle Gibbons
except to request she return Ian's confidential
Theranos papers
  - she didn't hear from Theranos ever again

Paranoia at Theranos increased
- bullet proof glass in Holmes's office
- security escorts
  - "Eagle 1 (Holmes), Eagle 2 (Balwani)
on the move
- Balwani would keep logs of when key
cards were scanned
- emails sent without Holmes or Balwani
CC'd would result in a response from
Balwani anyways
  - Erika Cheung knew she was being monitored

Cheryl Gafner, the receptionist, found out
that he desktop had a key stroke logger
---the receptionist...

Everyone had to sign extensive NDAs
- can't speak poorly about the company
- can't speak to family about work

2013, Theranos went live
- testing Walgreens customers in Arizona
- Edison machines weren't approved by
regulators for in-store testing
- Theranos was running out of money
and needed the Walgreens deal to attract investors
- Holmes introduced a stop-gap plan
- patient's samples were not tested on-site
in stores, rather, their samples
would be sent to Palo Alto to be tested
in a hastily built facility
with inexperienced staff
  - when one person quit, that person
was replaced w/ a dermatologist
- was able to raise over $400M in 
new investor captial 
because of the dea
  - the Walton Familiy
  - Betsy Duvas
  - owner of the NE Pats
  - Rupert Merdock, $125M

Patrick O'Neill
- Chief Creative Officer
- his purpose was to create a consumer brand
- "Simple. Human. Optimistic."
- convert the people who are afraid of needles
or of knowing their results or people
w/out insurance

Lab tests in some jurisdictions are only able
to be ordered under the guidance of a medical doctor
- Holmes lobbied Arizona legislature to change this
- HB 2645 - laboratory testing without physician order
- lab test a la carte

can't write a prescription for a patient
who hasn't been seen in-person by a physician
- physicians were not given a lot of info
from Theranos about the process or results

Theranos began giving out vouchers for
their lab tests

Theranos gift cards could be purchased

# POINT 
people were more willing to go along with
the Theranos story because they believed
it was for a good cause

John Carreyrou
- Wall Street Journal
- author of Bad Blood

David Boies
- his law firm represented Theranos
- had stock in Theranos
- worked w/ Harvey Weinstein, Al Gore,
questioned Bill Gates in deposition

Carreyrou's confidential contact
told him that there Edison could
only do a few tests and all the other
tests were accomplished via commercial means
- claimed Theranos would obfuscate the
accuracty of the tests

People would go into Walgreens expecting
a finger prick but would be met with a traditional
veinous blood draw

phlebotomists who gathered samples
weren't given a reason for the capillary
samples being taken less and less over veinous draws
- customers were told that the test they requested
required more blood than a capillary draw
could provide
- veinipuncture

The automated process idea was not
so automated
- there was lots of human interaction
- blood samples were being diluted, which
reduces the likelihood that results will
be accurate
- they were re-running failed QC tests
until they passed
- they were fudging results
  - throw out this one data point
to make the other 3 look good
- were running results on machines the
techs knew weren't working and then
handing the results back to a patient
# POINT
  - these inaccurate results could
have huge impact on a person's health
choices

hepatitis, syphilis, prostate cancer

variability in the syphilis testing
- 100 people tested for syphilis
  - 65 were told they had syp
  - 35 were told they weren't

Theranos tests did not match 
tests from other labs

Erika Cheung went to Balwani and told him
these tests were inaccurate
- he resonded: "What makes you qualified to make
that claim?"
- this led her to leave the company
- she believed it was all a show

Got chummy w/ the Obama admin
- gave tours to Biden
- was it her intent that if she 
got chummy w/ regulators that she would be
protected?

Holmes wouldn't go into detail with Theranos's dealins
the FDA
- FDA approval would be needed if Edison machines
were to be sold to consumers


CMS
- Theranos only gave CMS the data from third-party
machines
- CMS wasn't shown the internal lab
where Theranos testing was done during
the CMS inspection

Heather King
- legal counsel for Theranos
- worked for Boies

Cheung whistleblew to an regulatory agency

FDA finally approved a rarely used test for
herpes via the Edison
- a big celebration for a small thing

The Wall Stree Journal Article
"Theranos Has Struggled With Blood Tests
Silicon Valley lab, led by Elizabeth Holmes, is valued
at $9 billion but isn't...
technology for all the tests it offers"

15 tests on Edison
- 190 via othe labs

Around 2015, Silicon Valley companies
were staying private for much longer
- in some cases, this allowed fraud the thrive
- not beholden to public scrutiny
# POINT
- Palantir, Carbon, Cloudera
- not required to be as transparent

Shortly after the WSJ
article, Holmes was on Mad Money
- claimed that the article was entirely false
and was considering litigation

FDA banned use of nanotainer

CMS inspection was done at Theranos
and found that the tests were so inaccurrate
that it was a public safety issue
- prompted by the whistleblower letter
from Cheung

How Theranos Misled Me
Fortune article
- Roger Parloff
"I was misled - intentionally"

Ken Auletta didn't believe that she set out to deceive.
He believed her a zealot, and zealots sometimes
become so focused on their vision that the vision
becomes the perceived reality

Dan Ariely
- claims the people in Silicon Valley
frequently lie to investors
- they predict the future w/ solid numbers
- their aspirations are so great
that even they are unsure if they can
get there

Claims she had know idea about the issues in the
company until the inspection brought them to light
- how does the CEO have not a whiff
of these major issues?

2018
Theranos dissolved
- charged w/ conspiracy and fraud
- plead not guilty
