cell phones and internet did not exist when the constitution was written
pamphlets to photographs to rock music the video games to internet
each new medium was met with some level of scrutiny from the government and society

first amendment was written to protect offensive and controversial speech
covers not merely the spoken word but also written words, art, picture, podcasts

publishers may choose to ban speech they find offensive or unfitting their brand
