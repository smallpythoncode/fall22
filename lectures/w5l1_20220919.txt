Chapter 3 - Freedom of Speech

Don't go chasing waterfalls.

COMMUNICATION PARADIGMS
Regulation comms media

First Amend. protection and government regulation
- print media (newspapers, magazines, books)
- broadcast
- common carriers

Government has a duty to protect (to a degree)
the vulnerable and ensure those with power
do not abuse it

Editors of newspapers can modify letters
they receive as it is there paper. Should they
alter your words? It might be shitty. But
they stay in business by writing good content,
even out of context.

Postal system has restrictions on what can
travel via post. Won't send anything
potentially dangerous, as an example.
- flammables, lithium batteries,
chemicals, perishables, some liquids
  - these must be declared and may
be denied

Common carriers are similar to the post
- regulations on what can and can't
be done

The FA does not affect private companies.
They can choose to recject speech as they wish

Telecommuncations Act of 1996
- Changed regulartory structure and removed
artificial legal divisions of service areas
and restrictions on services that telephone
companies can provide.
- "No provider or user of interactive
computer services shall be treated as a
publisher or speaker of any information
provided by another information content
provider."
  - Section 230, the 26 word that
created the Internet

A number of years ago, there was an agreement
between ISP to set up "regions" where some
companies operate and others "stay of off
their turf"
- This is less common today, there is more
competition in the market

The companies that host communications
are not responsible for the individual
communications on their platforms
- Someone is sending death threats on
Facebook, Facebook is not liable

This notion created the framework of
how people interact w/ each other
on the internet

Without this in place, the communications
carriers would need to monitor every
single communication
- they need to report illegal activity
- they don't need to report distasteful
activity
- some people believe this is insufficient
and that some regulations should come
in place to address what may be viewed
as harassment

COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT OF 1996
- First major Intenet censorship law
- main parts were ruled unconstitutional

hosts of the content are not
legal owners of the content

section 230 is the section
that some want repealled

230 allows Yelp and TripAdvisor to exist
- w/o it, every 1 star review cracks open
the door to a libel lawsuit

Section 230 does not specifically
mention neutrality

There a laws separate from 230
that already cover hate speech

230 is what allowed Twitter to
remove Trump as a response to
Jan 6
- Trump started his own Twitter
called Truth Social
- They may allow whatever content
they want allow except content
or traffic that violates law

3.7 million videos are uploaded to
YouTube every day
- under 230, the would need to monitor
every second of video to check
for illegal content or potentially
liable content so they don't get sued

People who don't understand the content
are pushing for regulation that indicates
that they don't understand the technology
behind the proposed regulation

"We have to get one of these geeks to get
in here to explain this to us"
- an opening line to the Science committee
in congress

George Webb - the hoax peddler about the
cyclist in Wuhan

"The 26 Words that Created the Internet"
- the book

Lenny Pozner - son was killed at Sandy Hook
- founded the Honor Network

WDBJ Shooting video - Allison Parker
- don't go looking for it, just know
it's out there

One thing to consider about opening
a business is that you would need to keep
a lawyer on retainer to review content
that it may protected from libel charges

Alex Jones has to pay $45 million
in punitive damages for defamation
over Sandy Hook comments

If a limit is to be placed on speech,
who is the one to decide which speech is
acceptable and which is not?
