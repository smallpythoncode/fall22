CHANGES, FEARS, AND QUESTIONS

the introduction of computers
in the workplace generated many
fears
- mass unemployment due to increased
efficiency
- the need for increased skill and
training widens the earning gap
new trends still generating fears
- offshoring of jobs will lead
to mass unemployment
- employers use of tech to monitor
their employees

the fear of comp tech persists today
- loss of control
- loss of privacy
- jobs at risk
  - offshoring is cheaper
- happens in both private and
public sector

IRS even offshored
- the information to offshore
contractors is (allegedly) sanitized
- this is partly why Biden
hired 86K new employees, to bring
those jobs back to the US

IMPACTS ON EMPLOYMENT
- certain jobs are eliminated
- but many are also created

job creation and destruction
- a successful tech eliminates or
reduces some jobs but creates others
  - switch board operators, almost
exclusively female
  - reduced the need for telephone
operators, meter readers, mid-level
managers
- on the flip side, new
jobs were created to install and
maintain the new tech
- new industries arise
  - internet
  - cell commms
- lower prices increase demand
and create jobs
  - music industry changed from serving
the weatlhy to serving the masses,
employing more than just musicians

first computers didn't have
integrated circuits but tubes
- maintaining all of those
tubes and wires was a job
creation opportunity
  - wires were color coded
  - smaller rate of color
blindness in women than man
  - a contributing factor
to the greater presence of women
doing these jobs

5G waves are relatively close
to the hertz (do i know that?)
of microwaves

robots don't ask for pentions or
salaries or health care
robots don't show up late or
call out sick
- efficient and precise performance
for repetitive type of work
robots don't join unions

really the only cost is
upfront and maintenance

IMPACTS ON EMPLOYMENT
- robots contributed to emphasis
of importance on low-skill work
to high-skill work
  - there are some jobs that robots
can't do well
  - these require highly-skilled
human workers

job creation and destruction
- unemployment rates flucuate
  - growth of computers has been
steady, while unemployment
has fluctuated widely
- unemployment has more to do w/
an economy's ability to
adapt to change

a lot of the farming tasks
these days are now automated
- irrigation, plowing, etc
ran by computers
- someone needs to design, build
and maintain these pieces of
equipment

- are we earning less?
  - people generally are working
fewer hours compared to, say,
the industrial revolution
  - since the 70s, wages
decreased but fringe benefits
increased
  - people work fewer hours since
the IR
  - decrease in take-home pay may
be due to other factors (e.g.,
increased taxes)
  - purchasing power increases as
prices fall

the 800K person factory in china
to build apple products has
a high rate of depression
- many humans doing jobs that
a robot would have no difficulty
or care performing
  - implementing suicide nets
every third level
    - the height at which a jump
might cause death (about
40 ft)
- China has 9-9-6 work
policy
  - not law, per se, but
is the social norm

Some European countries are
experimenting in the opposite
direction
- 4 work days, 6 hrs

there are serious health
considerations to working too
often
- but do employers care?

  - perhaps remove # at the end

strong uptick in unemployment
08/09
- slow trickle back down
huge spike 2020

every bit of information
that travels through
the internet is stored somewhere

changing skills and skill levels
- machines can do repetive tasks
more precisely and more efficiently
  - don't feel stress or
exhaustion
- new products and services
based on computer tech create
jobs in design, marketing,
manufacturing, sales, customer
service, repair, and maintenance
- the new jobs created from
computers are different from
the jobs eliminated
- new jobs such as computer
engineer and system analyst
jobs require a college degree,
where jobs such as bank
tellers, customer
service reps and clerks don't
- companies are more willing
to hire people w/o specific
skills when they can train new
people quickly and use automated
systems
  - debatable that computer
engineering requires a college
degree

- a lot of the new jobs
are focused around creativity
  - designing new systems
  - elon musk creating new
rocket systems
- looking at existing problems
and finding creative out
of the box solutions
  - may break norms
  - elon's rockets bring fuel back
    - reuse parts

machine learning, ai
- these concepts were initially
mentally explored in the 50s
  - the tech just wasn't available
back then
  - we have that tech today

some of these questions will
be on the final
- what jobs have been eliminated
due to tech?
- what jobs that were once
considered high-skill jobs
are now low-skill jobs due
to technology?
- what new jobs have been created
because of technology?
- do automated systems mean fewer
jobs for high-skilled workers?
- will human intelligence
in employment be
"devalued"?
