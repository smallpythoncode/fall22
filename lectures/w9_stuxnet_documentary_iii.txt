stuxnet was a revolution in the threat landscape

prior malware had a callback to an operator
and wait for more commands

stuxnet couldn't have a c2 cape as there
is an airgap

there is not truly airgapped network
- need to update code, retrieve code

it may not be connected to the internet
- but it is accessbile

first time natanz was infiltrated via
human means

code and logic needed to be able to act
on its own
- attack can't be called off
- there was no turning back once it was released

stuxnet would wait for 13 days
- when the centrifuges are likely to be full
- payload delivered

stux would record the "good" data
- send the good data after cent ran
for 2hz or 1400hz for a minute
  - breaking it as it normally operates
at 1000hz

stux intercepted the gradual shutdown
code and prevented it

stux was blowing up cents and the
iran had no idea what was going on
- pushed to the negotiating table
- scientists fired
  - they assumed sabotage of
incompetence

2010
code was changed

cyber solution needed to be implemented
- human implementers couldn't always update
the code to the target system

code analyzers discovered version numbers
prior version were less aggressive

aggression needed to be balanced
- too aggressive, it spreads to absolutely
everywhere
- not aggressive enough and it couldn't
pass through airgaps

nsa devs laughed at the idea of an airgap
- there is an idea

stux kept a log of the machines that
it infected

the government was okay with it spreading
to innocent computers to ensure
that it had wide reach and eventually reach
natanz

israel took the code
- modified it and sent it off
without coordinating w/ US
- isreal gov gave great pressure to program
managers
- isreal fucking with the code made it
more noticeable
  - started shutting down computers
  - this is how we know about it

identified in belarus
- eventually, russia and iran got their
hands on the code

stux is an attack in peacetime on
infrastructure

ts/nf doc titled
presidential policy directive/ppd-20 was
eventually leaked by snowden
- stated that each use of a cyber
weapon requires a presidential sign-off
