stuxnet was a revolution in the threat landscape

prior malware had a callback to an operator
and wait for more commands

stuxnet couldn't have a c2 cape as there
is an airgap

there is not truly airgapped network
- need to update code, retrieve code

it may not be connected to the internet
- but it is accessbile

first time natanz was infiltrated via
human means

code and logic needed to be able to act
on its own
- attack can't be called off
- there was no turning back once it was released

stuxnet would wait for 13 days
- when the centrifuges are likely to be full
- payload delivered

stux would record the "good" data
- send the good data after cent ran
for 2hz or 1400hz for a minute
  - breaking it as it normally operates
at 1000hz

stux intercepted the gradual shutdown
code and prevented it

stux was blowing up cents and the
iran had no idea what was going on
- pushed to the negotiating table
- scientists fired
  - they assumed sabotage of
incompetence

2010
code was changed

cyber solution needed to be implemented
- human implementers couldn't always update
the code to the target system

code analyzers discovered version numbers
prior version were less aggressive

aggression needed to be balanced
- too aggressive, it spreads to absolutely
everywhere
- not aggressive enough and it couldn't
pass through airgaps

nsa devs laughed at the idea of an airgap
- there is an idea

stux kept a log of the machines that
it infected

the government was okay with it spreading
to innocent computers to ensure
that it had wide reach and eventually reach
natanz

israel took the code
- modified it and sent it off
without coordinating w/ US
- isreal gov gave great pressure to program
managers
- isreal fucking with the code made it
more noticeable
  - started shutting down computers
  - this is how we know about it

identified in belarus
- eventually, russia and iran got their
hands on the code

stux is an attack in peacetime on
infrastructure

ts/nf doc titled
presidential policy directive/ppd-20 was
eventually leaked by snowden
- stated that each use of a cyber
weapon requires a presidential sign-off

Noone in the government would even whisper
anythin about stux
- couldn't say "computer network attack"
  - former director of NSA stating this
is overclassified
- claimed as a matter of national security
- dripping in secrecy

David Sanger wrote a piece for NYT
given a full timeline of stux events

Gen James Cartwright
was charged with potential espionage
- perhaps I misheard
for discussing details that may
have related to Stux

NSA polygraphed everyone in the light
of the potential leak
- even the interns

Why is the US still so secret about stux
even though it's clear to the world
that the US did this
- we can talk about bunker buster weapons
- why not this weapon system?
  - perhaps because if the US acknowledged it,
it would send the message to the world
that this is now a legitimate form of warfare
and is allowed to be used in the "parlance" of
battle

Treaties on cyber warfare don't exist right now
- uncharted territory
- kinetic attacks are obvious
- cyber attacks are very gray
  - how much is an attack is an "attack"

nuclear inspections of both sides are commonplace
- what and where would you even inspect
if there was a cyber treaty
- russia and china don't really come to the table
as far as reaching agreements on cyber warfare

the norm for cyber is "do whatever you can
get away with"

international law on this matter is written by
custom
- this is what we did, this is why we did it
- perhaps the US doesn't want to acknowledge
stux because then that discussion is now
on the table

as a nation, we need to have a debate on the use
of cyber weapons because we are extremely vulnerable
to cyber attacks ourselves

the critical infrascture we depend on today
we built decades ago
- security wasn't in mind at the time
- there are vulnerabilities up and down
  - which elements are easy to get into
- we know that a number of these
systems have been hacked by foreign
entities

Iranian Cyber Army
- many have joined as a response to the
public shaming of Iran brought on by
stux attack

responded with 2 attacks
saudi aramco
- biggest oil company in the world
- 30K computer devices
  - every line of code was wiped out
surge attack on US banks

Obama let the private sector deal
w/ the US bank attacks

Iran stated "we know you did this...
knock it off because we can do it too."

Nitro Zeus
- the overarching program
that stuxnet was a part of
- allegedly
- hundreds of millions of dollars
  - perhaps billions
- assumed US would be dragged into conflict
if Israel launched attack
- degraded IADS and civilian systems
- Stuxnet was a back alley operation
in light of Nitro Zeus

July 14, 2015
- agreement w/ Iran to not enrich weapons
grade uranium for at least the next 10 years
- behind this deal was a lot of US confidence
in their cyber capability w/in Iran
  - Us has their tentacles there still today
- Nitro Zeus is the cyber warfare futuristic
science fiction we've all had nightmares about

If power is disabled, then water can't be filtered
if this carries on for weeks, lots of people die
- if we can do it to them, they can do it to us
