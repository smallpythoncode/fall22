Telecommuting
- working at home using a computer
to electronically link to one's place
of employment

out of your car or at customer locations
- fulltime and partime telecommuting
- some companies were doing it prior
to covid, but covid made it
widespread

1. 
reporting to a building to
do a knowledge-based job
is a relatively new concept

offices had to be invented
- have evolved over time

4 key moments in the history of
modern offices

action office
- combination of privacy
and openness
  - flexibility

copied by other companies
and warped into more modularity
- created the cubicle

didn't help social skills
- but helped with focus

telecommuting
- brought on initially by oil
crisis
  - gas costs money
- experimented with the tech
availablity of the 80s and 90s
- increased viability
dramatically with the introduction
of cell phones
  - early days, minutes cost money

personal computers
- started w/ alan turing
- IBM used to offer rental computers
for $15K a month
- computers became more avaiable
  - used cards and tape
  - computers were secluded to rooms
  - required a high level of skill

tape was the cheaper way of recording
media
- much cheaper than a hard disk
- some companies still use this
form as backup today

desktops made work more insular
- became more so w/ email

email
- brought about in the 90s for free
- people didn't get up
and talk to people or go through
a secretary
- 3 desks down? send them an email

2.
work experience of teleworkers
- at least 3 days compared to office people strictly

teleworkers experienced benefits
- more job satisfaction
- less work/life conflict
- less stress and time pressure
  - associated w/ meetings
- less aware of office politics
- surprisingly, teleworkers
reported as much work-related
information required to do their
jobs as the people in the office
  - are people in the office receiving
info overload
- teleworkers made less unimportant
contact (bs talk) with fellow workers

telework has benefits and downsides
- isolating but less stress

Benefits
- reduces overhead for employers
  - no need to run the heat
for an empty building
  - some hospitals have eliminated
physical IT depts
- reduces need for large offices
- employees are more productive, satisfied,
and loyal
  - alleviates parents of worry about their
parents
- reduces traffic congestion, pollution, gas use,
and stress
- reduces expenses for commuting and money spent
on work clothes
- allows work to continue after blizzards,
hurricanes, etc

telecommuting is driving new topics of
reserach
- covid

Problems
- employers see resentment from those who have to
work at the office
  - "essential personnel"
- for some telecommuting employees,
corporation loyalty weakens
- odd work hours
  - task oriented vs time oriented
  - putting in 12 hours was considered a bad
thing
- cost for office space has shifted to the
employee
  - personal electricity costs to pay
for company work
  - some companies make up for this
    - help cover costs of employees'
electricity
- security risks when work and personal
activities reside on the same
computer

# may be on test
discussion questions
- would you want to telecommute? why or why not?
- how has tech made entrepreneurship easier?
- harder?

A Global Workforce
- outsourcing - phenomenon where a company
pays another company for services instead
of performing those tasks itself
  - not necessarily overseas
  - contracting
- offshoring - the practices of moving
business processes or services
to another country, especially overseas,
to reduce costs
  - country boundaries are not a limiting
factor as for as providing
products or services
  - exposes a domestic workforce to
international competition
- inshoring - when another company employs
thousands of people in the U.S.
(e.g. offshoring for a German company
means inshoring for the U.S)
  - reverse of offshoring
- almost 5% of workers are employed by a
foreign company

some people oppose offshoring
- the irony of is that first world countries
were the ones who pushed for globalization
- they did not foresee that smaller nations
would also be able to work in first
world economies

airlines pushed for open skies
- prior to, Air Canada could fly passengers
into US, but could not then
fly passengers to Mexico
- now, Air Canada can go from Canada
to US to Mexico

3.
obtaining goods or services from 
outside the company
- widespread thanks to the Web

janitorial services are a very
common example of outsourcing

GoDaddy provides
web dev services
- a small company can outsource
this to GD and maintain it
  - they run it on their servers

4.
outsourced contractors do not
touch the core functions
of the core business
- they do a very narrow function
- even so, small threat of
leaking business secrets

Nike offshore outsources
- they don't do any of the manufacturing
- they just do the designing
- they don't do their own distribution

Apple doesn't do any of their own
phones
- not a single phone
- they outsource all of their
own distribution and manufacturing

5.
Inshoring
moving a business operation from overseas
back to HQ country
