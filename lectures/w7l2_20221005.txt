Intellectual Property in an Age of Open Source
- Liam Greenbank

2015 - Happy Birthday song became public domain
- restaurants came up w/ their own bday songs
to avoid lawsuit

IP theory is that it progresses society
and human development
- but does it actually?

"the rights given to persons over the creations
of their minds"
- World Trade Org def of IP

Patents, trademarks, copyright

Why does IP exist according to WTO
- encourage and reware creative work

Many different industries don't think
in these terms, i.e., selling rights
- teachers share resources and ideas
w/out charge
- chefs will come up w/ a new recipe but
probably won't charge for it
- these industries advance at a quicker
rate because there is not charging for
info and services

Pharmeceutical industry
- charge high prices and dev patents
- claim as a way to recup the cost
of R&D
- 700 billion in profit from top
10 pharma companies in last 10 years
(2019)
- Lemtrada, created for leukemia
- bought by pharma from Cambridge
  - patented
- in smaller doses helped w/ MS
  - repackaged w/ a higher price
- similar for prices of HIV drugs
  - Africa can't really afford it
- huge amounts of research and money
has gotten into male patern baldness
  - higher profit potential

Monsanto
- first company to put a patent on
a natural resource (a cotton seed)
- 300K Indian farmers have taken their
own lives by drinking the pesticide
that Monsanto said they wouldn't need
when buying this very expensive seed

Apple vs. Samsung
- arguments over who created the
curvature in cell phones
- public cost to upkeep courthouses
where these disputes are settled

25% of auto-immune drugs are derived
from 1% of the plants in the Amazon
- estimated 92% of the vegetation species
in the Amazon have not been explored
for medicinal use
- Amazon cultures are open-source
  - nature provides, no IP

Used to pay $10 for an album
Now we pay $10 for access to a streaming
service w/ all of the songs

Doesn't this hurt the artists?
- well, now they can make money other ways
  - concerts, interacting w/ fans
  - Radiohead release an album in 2011 for free
if the cust likes but can donate if they like

Encyclopedia Britannica used to be an
authoritative source
- now, wikipedia is more accessible, covers
more topic, and can be contributed to by a
greater number of people

Some say we need IP to drive competition
- companies are more interested in market
share than individual pieces of tech

3 individuals in the US have more collective
wealth than 50% combined wealth of the same
country

Why do we tell our children of the importance
of sharing when we enforce IP and limit its
distribution
