Ch 4 - Intellectual Property

A bit of history
- 1997 No Electronic Theft Act made it a felony
to willfully infringe copyright by reproducing
or distributing one or more copies of
copyrighted work with a total value of more
than $1000 within a six-month period
- 1998 Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA)
prohibits making, distributing, or using tools to
circumvent tech copyright protection systems and
included protection from some copyright lawsuits
for Web sites where uses post material
- 2005 congress made it a felony to record a movie
in a movie theater

These are testament to how special interest groups
can have an influence on congress

Fair Use Doctrine
Four factors considered
- purpose and nature of use - commercial (less
likely) or nonprofit purposes
- nature of copyrighted work
- amount and significance or portion used
- effect on potential market or value of
the copyright work (will it reduce the sales
of work?)

No singler factor alone determines a violation
Not all factors are given equal weight
- varies by circumstance

Fair Use almost certainly protects
material used for strictly educational
purposes
- Hidden Figures movie
  - woman who developed mathematical
models and formulas to allow
NASA to put a man on the moon
  - outlined contributions of
previously unknown black women
- John Glenn - first US man in space
  - first mission supported by computers
  - he was not going to green light the
trip until these women ran the verified
the computers' calculations

- Imitation Game movie used in class
  - Alan Turing
- CSCI 435 covers Turing Machines
  - alogrithms, machines doing things

These were used in class (in full)
for nonprofit purposes
- parts that did not relate to compute
sci were skipped, which enhanced
the fair use case
- further supported by the fact
that if it was missed in class
and that was a condition of extra
credit, the student would have to
go buy it or rent it, thus giving
money to the studio
- there is no loss of value
  - small class size
  - may encourage the students to
purchase a copy for themselves

Courts look at what has been done,
the intent behind it, and whether
those potentially infringed have lost
anything substantial from it

Ethical arguments about copying
- copying or distributing a song or computer
program does not decrease the use and enjoyment
any other person gets from his or her copy
- copying can decrease the amount of money
that the copyright owner earns

second bullet was very true pre-technology
the first bullet is the truer of the 2 today
- artists willing release songs today as a
promotion for other products, services
  - increase concert ticket sales
  - promote a podcast

TLC - Lisa Lopez died in Puerto Rico
- they would come up w songs
- the recording companies would front a loan
for the songs production
  - engineering
  - studio time
  - editing
- the company would then own the copyright
  - the artists would get a (commonly very) small
percentage as royalty
- they would need to pay back the loan
it took to the produce
- In TLC's case, the loan repayment w/
interest was greater than the royalties received
  - they lost money on the deal initially

Today artists take a more active part in
song distribution
- no longer prodcution and distribution
of physical media, such as CDs
- today, everything is streaming
- artists release a few songs
  - encourages people to buy the full album

tech has changed the way copyright law is
interpreted

arguments
- copying enables users to try out products
benefiting the copyright owner by encouraging
sales
- businesses and organizations should make their
own decisions about marketing products, not
consumers who want free samples
- fair use guidelines are useful ethical
guidelines
- there are many arguments for and against
unauthorized copying

Discussion Questions
1. How is intellectual property like
physical property?
2. How is intellectual property different
from property?
3. Do you agree w/ the idea that someone
can "own" intellectual property?

SIGNIFICANT CASES
Sony v Universal City Studios (1984)
- SC decided that the makers of a device
w/ legitimate uses should not be penalized
because some people may use it to infringe
on copyright
- Sony developed the Beta Max recorder
  - Sony's version of a VCR but better
quality
  - kept it a proprietary device
    - wouldn't allow tech released so
multiple manufacturers could have the
tech as well
- SC decided copying movies for later
viewing was fair use
- arguments against
  - people copied the entire work
  - movies are creative, not factual
- Universal stated the device violated
their copyright
  - rather than viewing at a particular
time on TV, it could be watched later
according to convenience

A middle school had a fundraiser and
sold tickets for the screening of a movie
- sued by Disney
- school had to pay a fee to Disney
  - $250
  - go fund me covered the difference
between the fee and the amount
raised at the fundraiser
- this is a legitimate breach
  - not fair use
- Disney received a lot of flak for this

Arguments for fair use (sony)
- the copy was for private, noncommercial use
and generally was not kept after viewing
- the movie studies could not demonstrate
that they suffered any harm
  - there were already paid by the
television broadcaster
- the studio received a substantial fee
for broadcasting movies on TV, and the
fee depends on having a large
audience who view for free
  - based on antitcpated viewership

REVERSE ENGINEERING: GAME MACHINES
- Sega Enterprises v Accolade 1992
- Atari v Nintendo (1992)
- Sony v Connectix (2000)
- courts ruled taht reverse engineering does
not violate copyright if the intention
is to make new creative workes (video games),
not the original work (the game systems)

SHARING MUSIC: NAPSTER
- Napster's agruments for fair use:
- The sony decision allowed for entertainment
use to be considered fair use
- did not hurt industry sales becasue users
smapled music on Napster and bought the CD
if they liked it
- peer-to-peer
- bandwidth was a huge issue
  - resulted in lower quality of the music copies
- RIAA against
- "personal" meant very limited use, not trading
w/ thousands of strangers
- songs and music are creative works and users
were copying whole songs
- claimed Napster severly hurt sales

- court ruled sharing music via copied MP3 files
violated copyright
  - Napster had responsiblity to stop this violation

- Napster provided the gateway, they did not
store any of the music

YouTube is not liable for copyright infringement
but they are have a responsiblity to remove
videos that violate

RIAA arugments
- companies are required to make an effort
to prevent copy violations and Nap did not take
sufficient steps
- Nap was not a device or a new tech and RIAA
was not seeking to ban the tech
- court rules Nap liable because they ahd
the right and ability to supervise the system
including copy infring activities

File sharing: MGM v Grokster
- Grokster, Gnutella, Morpheus, Kazaa provided
p2p file sharing services
  - the companies did not provide a central
service or list of songs
  - p2p file transfer programs have legitimate uses
- lower courts ruled that p2p does have
legitimate uses
- SC ruled that IC owners could sue the companies
for encouraging copy infring

"look and feel"
- refers to features such as pull-down menus,
windows, icons, and finger movements and specific
ways they are used to select or initiate actions
- reflects major creative effort by programmers

iPhone
Apple patented the corners on the phone
- other brands could have the save curvature

RESPONSES FROM THE CONTENT INDUSTRIES
- Ideas from the software industries
  - expiration dates w/in the software
  - dongles
  - copy protection that prevents copying
  - activation or registration codes
  - court orders to shut down Internet bulletin boards
and Web sites

- trial applications of software
  - a month free use or x number of app openings
  - then must purchase

International Piracy
- some countries do not recognize or protect IP
- countries that have high piracy rates often do not have
a significant software industry
- many countries that have a high amount of piracy are
exporting the pirated copies to countries w/ strict
copyright laws
- economic sanctions often penalize legitimate businesses,
not those they seek to target

Microsoft enlisted the FBI to protect IP
- FBI agents would travel to these countries
- "we will enforce our laws on you over here" says FBI
- travelers would buy a copy of Office and install
it on every machine in their office back home
- MS told these people that they will not inform
the FBI if they purchase a multi-pack licensing agreement
  - they knew there were several installs because
of license nums used several times
- a sheet of paper (certificate) stating authorization
for number of copies of stolen and agree to pay a fee
of a low amount per desktop per desktop
- agree to purchase the latest update when it comes out
- contractually obligated to do the right thing
in the future
- protected MS on future sales
