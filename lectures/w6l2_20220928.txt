The French government once demanded Google take down
a search result as it affected one man's ability to
find employment. They threated G w/ a fine if they
did not take it down. Should G have to comply?
Does this infringe on freedom of speech? freedom
of research?

Google was in China. They eventually left because
of all of the demands placed on G to restrict
certain information. They were leary of entering
China at all because they Chinese govt placed
some mild restrictions on the the Chinese
version of G initially. These restrictions
eventually grew over time to the point
where G noped out.

Separate countries have separate laws on how social
media can use and distrubute information. These laws
are often dissimilar. Is it okay for county courts
to fine companies whose citizens inadvently access
these sites that the company has no intention of
operating in? Should there even be different versions
of websites tailored to a country's whims?

Selling surveillance tools
- repressive govts intercept citizens' comms and
filter Internet content
- Companies in Western democracies sell them the
sophisticated tools to do so

Some companies who sell these tools have elected
to not sell these tools to repressive govts
who will cross ethical boundaries

What is Clear View?

Should surveil software sell to Iran who may
use the system in a way that may lead to
people's execution?

Shutting down comms in free countries
- public safety
  - "public safety"
- In the US, the SC would probably declare unconstitutional
a law that uthorized a govt agency to order a private
comms service to shut down

There have been lawsuits against gun manufacturers
stating that their products have caused undo harm
- Should biometric locks be enforced in gun sales?

A similar argument is being pushed against tech/socmed
companies
- Should these companies implement procedures and
programs that protect persons from extreme emotional
harm?
- Reputational harm?
- Financial harm?
- Is it the company's responsibility to control
how people use the internet?

Net neutrality

The net neutrality issue came to prominence due to Blockbuster
- Blockbuster's business model was to rent out movies for relatively cheaply
but would charge high late return fees
- Some dude got pissed at these fees and started a competing company, Netflix
  - mailed out DVDs w/ no late fees
- Netflix started streaming once the tech was available
- Streaming companies are making shit tons of money off
the backs of ISPs who maintain the fiber
  - Brought about the net neutrality question:
Should the ISPs get a cut?
  - ATT, Comcast, etc. would structure how the internet
is used using a tier system
- Net n. is the principle that no user should have
a better transmission rate (an advantage) on the internet
than any other user

Three principles
- no blocking
- no throttling
- no pay-for-preference

ISPs oppose net neutrality
- they say that the 3 principles would never happen
  - they point that regulation is already in place to prevent these
  - they say they are not going to slow anyone down from the base
rate, they are just going to enhance the higher paying customers'
access

Net N. became official policy under Obama admin, 2016
- reversed under Trump, 2017
  - courts upheld this decision in 2019 meaning
net n. is not currently and FCC policy
