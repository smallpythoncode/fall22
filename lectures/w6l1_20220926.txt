Applications of Hacking
Shopping and banking is done almost exclusively online
- we are a number on a screen

hackers utilize resumes posted online to glean intel
of potential targets

2013 Target hack - several million names, CC numbers, phone
nums, etc were stolen

Satano trojan steals passwords and usernames

hacktivisim - use of hacking to promote a political cause
DoJ site changed to Dept of Injustice

Some think it is ethical but others think it is a crime
- can this be justified if it to promote a politial cause

Hacking by governments
- military and economic espionage

Can be traced to a country of origin but it is
tough to detect whether it is by state or private actors

There are not just individual hackers but state
and international hackers who may hack for political gains
as well as financial

Why the digital world is so vulnerable

Main thing - it is made by humans
- they often focus on single projects
- bound to have miscomms
  - OS try to give you as much control as possible
  - more control, less ability to make it secure
  - in the 90s, could not opt out of auto-update systems
  - devs hated it because they lost individual control over how
their own systems operated

There was not mass adoption of the Net in the early stages
- universities and big business
- mainly used for communication
- little need for security because what was there to protect?

Dan Farmer ran a vulnerability test
- 2/3 of the sites he evaluated had vulnerabilities
- companies didn't care

Open SSL - heart leak vulnerability
- open source
- Open SSL was ran by a single guy who got paid like $2K
to maintain the system

New software is developed every day
- it is tough to predict all ways people try to misuse the software

Cars with computers are rarely updated

A lot of people just don't care to update their systems
- including cars

Self-driving cars, automated drones, medical implants
- each of these have vulnerabilities

Security

As tech progresses, there needs to be frequent updates to how
we keep our information secure

Credit Cards were very unsecure
- just needed the number to use it
- progressed by needing to activate it before use
- credit card skimmers would steal the info of CCs
  - nearly impossible to track
- nowadays, chipped cards are encrypted

Encryption
- SHA-256
  - nearly impossible to brute force
  - would require many, many, many years
- public key encryption

Virus protection
- scans newly installed software to detect for possible malware
- quarantines potentially maliciious code

What to trust?
- software can be released with certificates
  - not perfect --> can be forged

People set up malicious sites
- Google often filters these out from the search engine
- It is very dangerous to follow direct links in email

Captcha
- used to check if a real person is using the application
- using the service in the way intended

Dev of new security
- doing new research
  - gray hats
  - will hack for fun and share the findings for the greater good
- DEFCON
  - info sharing
- selling companies their own security solutions

biometrics help enhance security
- good as a firewall, but if the wall falls, a person w/ malicious intent
now has all of your biometrics

sometimes the government wants to break into phones
- The government wanted Apple to make a phone's info available

People are the worst at making security measures because people
are fallible and are very unlikely to fathom all of the ways
that a person may try to circumvent security measures
- simple mistakes may have have drastic consequences

HAVE SECURE PASSWORDS!!
- don't use the same password for several things

================================================================================

"The office of communications is ordered to find ways to ensure that the use of the
Internet becomes impossible. The Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention
of Vice is obliged to monitor the order and punish violators.
- excerpt from Taliban edict banning Internet use in Afghanistan (2001)

He who controls the narrative holds the power

internetworldstats.com
- used to see internet users in places around the world

40M population in Afgahn (2022 est.)
1000 in 2000
over 9M in 2022

Will the Internet and related comms techs be tools for increasing political freedom,
or will they give more power to govts to spy on, control, and restrict their people?

- china's social credit system

1. Everything you do is tracked and affects your score
- mortgages, boarding a train
- every move is watched

200M surveillance cameras
Sesame credit helps algorithms for this system
350-950 range

too much alcohol or video games decreases scores

pressures you to become a better citizen
- a warning

Mandatory once fully rolled out

counterfeit goods were a factore in the implementation of the system

in one town, you start w/ a 1000 points

posters are posted around town displaying what will cause a score to
rise and fall

there are town snitches who go aroud looking for good and bad behavior

blacklisted people are not allowed to get hotel rooms, flights,
trains, or even get child care

apps are available to see who in your local area is blacklisted

nearly half of the sec cams in the world are in China

people believe that the abundance of security cams makes people
feel safe
- can identify age, glasses wear, sex, etc



In the US, we have financial credit systems only...for now
