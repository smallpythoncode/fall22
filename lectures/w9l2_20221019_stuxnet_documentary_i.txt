Hacking as foreign policy
- hacking by govts has increased
- Pentagon has announced it would consider and treat some
cyber attacks as acts of war, and the US might respond
w/ military force
- How can we make critical systems safer from attacks?

STUXNET
- an extremely sophisticated worm
- targets a particular type of control system
- beginning in 2008, damaged equipment in a 
uranium enrichment plant in Iran

THE CONTENTS OF THIS EXAM WILL BE ON THE FINAL!!!!

Different nation states choose to play by different rules

Nov 29, 2010 in Tehran, Iran
- 2 top scientists were targeted by hit squads
- major strategic sabotage
- allgedly from US and Israel
- Clinton (sec of state) publically denied any involvement

MOSSAD
- a narrator in the story
- senior operative
- israeli intelligence

Alex Gibney
- the interviewer
- AGIB

When AGIB asked MOSSAD is the assassinations
in Iran were related to the Stuxnet
computer attacks, MOSSAD insisted on moving
onto the next question

Iran's infrastructure was being targeted by
a powerful worm (spyware)

One news outlet stated that (at the time)
it was identified as 30000 instances

Security experts assessed that it required
the resources of a nation state

Stuxnet is part of a classified program officially
- noone wants to talk about it

"I don't know, and even if we did, we wouldn't talk
about it anyway"
- Michael Hayden, former NSA director

countries are comfortable discussing what they did
because they are unsure where they want the system to go

whoever was behind stux hasn't admitted to it

First surface in Belarus

man whose clients in Iran began to panic over an epidemic
of computer shutdowns
- Sergey Ulasen
  - antivirus expert, Belarus
- other viruses didn't have this kind of zero day
- it was the first time in his practice
- led him to the decision to notify security companies asap
of the danger

Wilders Security Forums

17 jun 2010 identification
- affects os in unusual way

Symantec Research Labs
- California

Eric Chien
works for symantec

Kaspersky, Eugene
collect millions of unique attacks every month
in the old days, it may only be dozens a month

traditional cyber criminals
- in it for the money
hactivists
- fun or politics
national states
- high-quality intel of sabotage activity

sec companies share binary samples and info
- samples are analyzed looking for strings or variable names
- combo of 2 variables led to name of stuxnet

Hamburg, Germany

Control Systems Security consultant
- Ralph Langner

went beyond our worst nightmares
the more bizarre the story got the more research was done

There was just bad things all over the code
- a hundred questions straight away

detective work
- who did it
- what is their motivation?
- new puzzles are difficult to put down
- work until 4 in the morning
  - liam worked w/ eric

needed to do deep analysis
- every single byte
- every single 01

one month into research, just then
discovered the payload
- the purpose of the worm

stux payload was 20x the size the average
piece of code

contains almost no bugs
- extremely rare

every piece of code does something
and does it right in order to conduct
the attack

the zero day element was a surprising find
it does what it does on its own with no interaction
- no .exe or embed into a file
- it just does
- nobody knows but the attackers
  - extremely rarely is elinated via system patches
  - can't patch something you don't know is there

zero days can be sold undergrand for hundreds of
thousand

4 zero days in stux
that same year 12 other zero days were identified

haven't seen it before and haven't seen since
- 4x zero days could be worth half a million

it was evident on early stage given the sophistication
that a nation-state was involved, at least one in the dev

usually nation-state code is scrubbed clean
- in stux there was a few left behind

in order to get low level access, stux
needed a digital certificate
- certifies that it came from a particular company

- the certs were stolen from 2 companies in taiwan
- nothing to do with each other except they are
located in the same business park in taipei

- intense physical security for certs
- multiple doors and multipel pople to unlock
both provide biometics and passphrases
- not simply on some machine connected to the internet

- felt like part of james bond movie
- never expected

eventually found more breadcrumbs
- siemens
  - maybe software or hardware
  - was never seen before
- targeting siemen plc
  - programmable logic controller
  - very small computer attached to physical equipment
such as pumps or motors
  - runs a digital program to set speed, turn on on
  - used in factories and critical infrastructure such as
power plants

stux designed to attack a very important piece
of crit infrastructure

when uploaded to test system
- discovered that malware was probing
for controllers
- quite picky on its target
- didn't just target any old plc
- went throught several checks
- when failed, would not deliver payload
- probing for a specific target

huge effort taken to develop to target
a very specific target
- unusual

stuxnet was seen all over the world
- spread to any windows machine
- very scary because the trigger was unknown
was it a timer?
was it looking for a specific number of machines infected?

many companies panicked because they were infected
and didn't know when anything was going to happen or
if they were a target

speed was of the essence
- a ticking bomb

iran was the number one country targeted
- predominant number of systems infected
- multiple explosions of gas pipelines going
in and out of iran
  - in the media, there was no explanation given
- sec company noticed the assassinations
of nuclear scientists

"Look, I'm not suicidal"

all of the PLCs have a unique identifier
that identify the make and model of that device
- a few of these numbers were identified in the code
- but didn't know what they were

searched for the numbers
- identified as frequency converted from 2
companies in Iran
- export controlled from nuclear regulatory commission
- the target is a nuclear facility

Robert Sanger
- nat sec correspondent NY times
- first, biggest, and most sophisticated example
of a nation state using cyber means for offensive purposes

Tehran nuclear research reactor
- construct in 1967

how did iran get its first reactor?
was given to them by US via the Shah
because the Shah was an ally at the time

Revolution overthrew Shah in 1979

policy against Iran was to deny them
nuclear technology

80s, 90s the US went around the world trying
to convince states to not give Iran anything nuclear,
even non-weapon material

The US missed the clandestine supply chains
- pakistan to Iran

Abdu Khan
- father of pakis nuclear program

Rolf Mowatt-Larssen
- cia opeartions officer 1982-2005

pakistan was the means by which
other countries could acquire
nuclear materials and tech

80s iran program was mostly a R&D
program
- not well resourced
-wasn't until 90s that a weapons program
gained traction

US invasion of Iraq after Kuwait was
the suspected reason for Iran developing
a weapons program
- US wiped out enemy forces in a matter of
weeks
- Iran wanted a means to defend itself

2003-2005 iran feared that US would invade

2006 US was bogged down in Afghanistan
- US no longer had capacity to threaten them
- the uranium enrichment continued

Natanz Fuel Enrichment Plant
- Isfahan Province Iran
- built in secret
- called it a desert irrigation facility
- a lot artillery and air force
- better protected from air attack
than other nuclear facilities viewed
- deeply underground
- inside, like any other centrifuge

what is the IAEA?
- what goes in? out?
- lower enrichment can't be used for weapons

facility is under 24/7 survellance from the UN
every single gram is accounted for
- seals IAEA seals are used for containers

isotope 236
- only seen in states w/ nuclear weapons
- realized that Iran had cheated the IAEA
- material was bought from the black market

surprised by the quality control and manufacturing
- result of long process

a centrifuge feeds in uranium gas
and out comes uranium enriched

finely tuned, any vibration it will blow up
temperature is finely controlled
- makes them very difficult to manufacture
- balance or rotation rate and managing temp

Iran has a National Nuclear Day
- propaganda distributed in April

aknaminjad iranian president
- claimed that he will deny inspections
- claims to have a right to nuclear
- who are they to say we can't have nuclear
- these words galvanaized the public

2007/08
US was leary over Iran's nuclear
- Bush couldn't come out and say that
iran was making them
- becasuse of the WMD fiasco in Iraq
- condolesa rice said to him that she thinks
he invaded his last muslim country even
for the best of reasons

He didn't want he israelis conduct a mil
operation

israel was saying they were going to bomb iran
- the US was gameplanning what to do if this happened
- israel has a good but small air force
- there is a great distance between israel and iran

The US wondered if Israel's intent was to destroy
Iran's nuclear capability or to coax the US
into war w/ Iran

Israel had more of a stake in the Iran's nuke
capability because they are closer and smaller

Iran would be the first Islamic zealots
should they have nuke weapon capability

Supreme Leader Khamenei

Once they have the fissile material,
the game is lost

"I don't want any president to be faced
with only 2 options: bombing or the bomb."
- Bush to Hayden

US and Israel have a good intel cooperation

Langner
- german cyber analyst

cyber intel services looked at the OSINT photos
- commercial and state services

one of the photos depicted a scientist giving
the president a tour
- he was assassinated a few months after the tour

There were six groups of centrifuges
- 164 entries
- this was a perfect match to the attack code
- targeting an array of 6 groups each w/
164 elements

PLCs (exact models) were obtained
ordered an air pump for proof on concept
Symantec guys
- settled on blowing up a balloon
- wrote a program to do this
- set to stop at 5 seconds
- inflate to a certain size
- won't blow up

infect this model w/  stuxnet
- ran test again
- the balloon blew up
- PLC signaled the pump to keep blowing
- piece of software that should exist
only in cyber realm that affects infrastructure
in the physical world

malware potentially killing people
in real life
