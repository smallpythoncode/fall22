CH 1 - Unwrapping the gift

The pace of change
The microchip has resulted in a greater leap forward than the printing press did
1940s - first computer built
56 - first HDD, 5 mb, weighed a ton
91 - space shuttle launched a 1 megahertz computer
- in the old days, data was stored on punch cards

first computer took up an entire room & ran on vacuum tubes
first digital computer, the atanasoff-berry computer (ABC)
- built in 1942 @ Iowa State College

Alan Turing - did some cool things
A Turing machine is an implementation of an algorithm, typically as hardware
- some have memory, some don't

Cell phones - few in the 90s
- approx. 5 billion in 2011
Phones are a critical aspect of modern life
- more a necessity than a nicety

Change and unexpected developments
- kill switches
  - allows remote disable ability & delete files
  - are in the OS of phones, tablets, and some desktops
  - designed for security, but raises concerns of autonomy

ethical questions arise from self-driving cars and "fire" autonomy for military equipment

Arian 4 software was put in Ariane 5 w/out testing
- kill switch is in all launch vehicles to blow it up to prevent casualties on the ground
- Arian 5 had an unintended trajectory and the switch was pulled

Software has a long way to go
- Tesla hardware is incredible
- It's software has yet to be programmed to a level of accuracy to predict all situations

As interfacing w/ devices has increased, face-to-face comms w/ fellow humans has seemed
  to decrease. Is this progress?

Do you blow the whistle in the face of ethical questions? Or do you continue to get paid?
