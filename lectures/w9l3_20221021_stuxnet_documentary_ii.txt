control over our devices and data

is it safer or more dangerous that these companies
try to control data

safer - sensitive data can be protected
more dangerous - threats can be identified

seller was trying to a book on kindle
that seller did not have rights to
- amazon removed it remotely and issued
refunds
- customers were upset becasue they were not
aware amazon had the ability to remove content
that they paid for
- amazon has not done it since
  - they recognize that it made them
uneasy
  - but do they still have the ability

Apple has the same ability
- removed an app that has malware w/in
- still, people were leary about the company
could control remotely

IT cells have the same ability
- can add and remove software at will

The intent is to keep harmful or buggy software
off of the systems
- updates can introduce their own bugs

Microsoft was transfering from windows 8 to 10
- updates at inconvenient times caused loss of
work
- at they time, mic stated that explicit consent
was needed for update
  - reports that it happened regardless
- updates are important but they are inconvenient
- people are leary about moving to 11 for update
reasons and privacy reasons

self driving cars
- are the updates full of bugs or smooth-running?
- a bit more life or death than a windows update

remote control is often intended to protect the customer
and people's rights
- but they people like muh data

==============================
Presentation 7.5
making decisions about tech
- putting things in perspective
- what are the limitations
- what equipment is best suited for certain environments

people will choose to use tech for mostly good reasons
but there is always a number who use it for ill

currently, major corporations and sometimes states
control the flow of tech
- there is no democracy, the people often don't have
a say

the guy who ran lambda from google (ai) was the ethics
guy
- brought up concerns and management ignored
- who decides what is ethical

What are the ethics that relate to the singularity

some people say that we should use more advanced
tech until we fully understand all the ethical implications

people really couldn't predict zoom calls for business
at the advent of computers

couldn't have predicted social media
at the advent of cell phones

Apple itself at one time was uncertain of its ability
to produce a smart phone
- now, iPhones are everywhere

experts were once skeptical about speech recognition
- used to take huge amounts of equipment
- what would customers even use it for?
- how would it be economically viable?

Where will social media go from here?
- can we even fathom?

will implants into the brain become a thing?
- can we download human brains into robot bodies
- given the exponential growth, it is a remote possibility

singularity
- the point at which tech is so advanced that
humans cannot fully understand it anymore

counter arguments
- hardware or software growth in tech may slow down
- increasing difficulty to reach singularity

Where do you draw the line on what to develop tech-wise
- is capitalism in line with such a tech utopia?
- do we prioritize tech or fellow humans?

Tech is being rapidly pursued
- Should we the people be involved?

Currently, tech companies at times don't worry about
the ethics
- they have stock holders to appease
- lawyers cost money
- just release it, bro

Presentation 8.1
FAILURES AND ERRORS OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS

because of the complexity of systems these days,
bugs are just expected
- but where is the human error?

individual errors
- mispell name
large amounts of people or large amounts of money
- tax eval systems
critical equipment
- aviation systems, medical

billing errors
- 6.3 million charged
- simple human error, bad input

large errors are easy to detect
- damage to reputation
- could have been circumvented with a software
test for extremes

even if there is only a 99.99% chance of error,
should the system automatically check for that?
or should some errors be left to a case by case basis?

a 14 year old was barred from football in high school
- also taking some classes
- the system code stated that he had done drugs
in middle school
- what actually happened was his previous school
had a different discipline documentation scheme
  - the old code said he chewed gum and was late to a class

data is just data
- what is the context behind the data?

a large population of people
- there is bound to be error

how to improve
- data entry auditing
- training people on what the data means

2002 congress passed authorization to make
voting more digital
a slew of bugs
- crashes
- votes going to the wrong people
- was it encrypted?
- what is physically secure?

lack of thought of security and planning
- people are lazy

some systems are so flawed that they are completely abandoned

british national health service
10 million pounds, system abandoned after 9
years due to frequent errors

legacy systems are still in use
- banks, airlines, etc
- big industries
- so advanced that upgrading it would
have great cost in time and money
- software documenation standards
were more lax
  - can't just call up the guy
who made it because he's dead
- cyber security was not a concern in
the 70s

2 main reasons why systems fail
1. task is extremely complex
- data taxing
2. built poorly
- no care taken in

sometimes it comes down to poor management
- if all that matters is getting code out
the door, corners will be cut
- sometime people are overconfident in their code

Aran 5 was aborted and blown up
- code reused from Aran 4
- passed the tests, but it was
a completely different system

some errors are easily detectable
- less obvious errors often go uncorrected

make they next guy's job easier
- write good code w/ good documentation

==============================
Presentation 8.2
PERSON WAS NOT HERE!

==============================

how can you do attribution to code?
- in such an attack, there isn't going to be
a banner saying, "hey, this was me. I did this."
- even if there was, such a thing could
be completely false

even civilians were uneasy to talk about stux
- they were afraid of pissign off DC
and Telaviv

confirming america's involvement on the record
the interviewer was masked with audio
and video obfuscation

This is not a Snowden kind of thing
- he was a rogue contractor who revealed too much

this person on camera was in NSA
- chose to speak because she believes
everyone is getting the story wrong
- can only go into so much detail
  - even though public analysis is pretty clear
on who did it
- she believes that we have to get the
story right in order to understand the heavy
implications of such a new weight

she says that the US for a fact did Stuxnet
- we came so close to disaster
- a huge multinational interagency operation
- CIA, NSA, Cyber Command
- CGHQ for britain
- unit 8200 in israel
  - they key to the sword was israel

Yossi
- has been covering Iran for 30 years


western values are very rare in Israel
- same w/ democratic
- has a western skin
- people seem very free
- there are lots of fanatics, religious zealots, etc

Yossi Melman
- he had a hunch that Israel was involved
because Israel has been trying to degrade
Iran's nuke capability from the beginning

1981 F-16 pilot
- have to be prepared for a long-range mission
to destroy a valuable target
- they weren't given intel on what the target was
- 600 miles from Israel
- Maj Gen Amos Yadlin
  - Commander of Israeli Defense Intel, 2006-2010
- no air refueling at the time
- no sats for recon
- limited fuel

accomplished the mission at the end of the day
- destroyed the Iraqi nuclear reactor
- Iraq was never able to reach the bomb

8200
- they break into computers
- block faxes and phone calls

when Yadlin joined, there was no cyber warfare unit
- they began to hire hackers from both
inside and outside the military

in 19 cen there was only army and navy
20 cen there was an air force
21 cen there came cyber
- a low signature global threat

the superpowers have to change how to view warfare

West Point
Info Warfare Live Fire Range
- Bush era was just the start
of investment in cyber weapons
- Robert Gates reviewed this program
and said it should be in the DoD
and said in should be in the intel community
- CIA operated
- NSA and 8200 developed
- newly created US Cyber Command
  - director of NSA has second role
of US Cycom
- same building as NSA at Fort Meade

Col Gary D Brown
- Staff Judge Advocate, Cyber comm 2009-2012

Operation Buckshot Yankee
- adversaries inside classified networks
- confidence that adversaries were kept at the
cyber perimter
  - came to the conclusion that cyber is never
truely secure

NSA uses it's abilities for defense
cyber comm takes responsibility for attacks

NSA has no legal authority to attack in cyberspace
cycom has the authority to attack

NSA was supposed to be a code breaking
and code making organization to monitor the comms
for foreign powers and American adversaries
- defensive posture
- creation of cyber comm meant using the same
tech for offensive purposes

tens of thousands of foreign computers
have implants from the US
- if you can spy on a system, you can exploit it
- only thing that is needed is an act of will
- Hayden

NSA had combat support teams in field in Iraq
- for the first time, mil forces had direct
access to NSA intel

over time, NSA thought more about offense than defence
NSA had access to all the traffic going in and out
of the country
- complete surveillance state
- follow adversaries in real time
- can access phones even if they were off
- can send messages to adversaries suggesting meeting
places, a trap for capture

How can cyber facilitate traditiona mil ops?

TAO-S321 "The ROC"
tailored access operations
- the NSA hackers
  - on net operators
  - the only people allowed at NSA to break in
or attack on the internet

remote operations center
- if the US govt wants to get into somewhere,
it goes throught the ROC
- so flooded w/ requests that only 30% of requests
could be fulfilled
- once inside a target network, they could watch and wait
- or they could attack

NSA never called it Stuxnet
- that was a name used by the antivirus guys

NSA called it the Olympic Games
Sandia National Labs in New Mexico
- here and fort meade was where the PLCs were tested
- that and Oak Ridge

Was there concerns that this was an act of war?
- if there were, some guy w/ glasses didn't find them
- this was an entirely new territory

Lawyers said this is what we may do, not what can
be done
- next level is what should be done
  - can and may, but is it a good idea?

Someone at NSA has to give the authority to launch
the attack

inside of the code was a kill date
- the date at which it could no longer be executed
- more normal attacks don't have such a thing
in the code
- there are laws governing how gov agencies can operate
  - evidence that a team of lawyers was there to
advise
- launch of attack was a few days before
Obama's inaguration
  - a clean change of command

Obama put a premium on cyber infrastructure
- talked at great length about defense
- when asked about offensive cyber, the crickets could be heard
  - white house, NSA, pentagon were all silent
- the budget stated that $52.6 billion was being
allocated to the development of offensive cyber weapons

Title 10 CNO
- T10 relating the the military
- CNO computer network operations
