PRIVACY RISKS AND PRINCIPLES

Terminology
Personal info - any info relating to an individual
informed consent - users being aware of what info
is collected and how it is used
invisible info gathering - collection of personal
about a user w/o the user's knowledge
Cookies - files a web site stores on a visitor's
computer
secondary use - user of personal info for a purpose
other than a the purpose for which it was provided
  - e.g. use of a driver's license for voting
data mining - seaching and analyzing masses of data
to find patters and develop new info or knowledge
computer matching - combining and comparing info
from different databases (using social sec num, e.g.)
to match records
computer profiling - analyzing data to determine
characteristics people most likely to engage in
certain behavior

two common forms of providing informed consent
are opt in and opt out
opt in - the collector of the info may use info
only if the person explicitly permits use (usually
by checking a box)
opt out - persom must request (usually by checking
a box or email) that an organization not use info

- the human particle: certain things are true about
almost all human beings in general
  - e.g., you will forget very unimportant details,
such as the color of someone's shirt from last week
  - another ex. most people will sign up for services
offered for free for a trial period but will forget
to cancel w/in a month
- some governments have taken this issue up to 
protect consumers
  - some entities use this very predatorially
- most people do not read the fine print of a deal

FAIR INFORMATION PRINCIPLES
1. Inform people when you collect information
2. Collect only the data needed
3. Offer a way for people to opt out
4. Keep data only as long as needed
5. Maintain accuracy of data
6. Protect the security of data
7. Develop policies for responding to law
enforcement requests for data
- controversial; will ISP, cell providers
cooperate?
  - San Bernadino attackers had their phones
protected; Apple refused LE request to give
the data as they assure the phones are hack
proof and lose a selling point by doing so
    - FBI paid $1M to get in; there
was nothing on phone
      - a university professor purchased
software/hardware for $100
- created a copy of the registers on the
iPhone and kept brute forcing the copy
- after 10 attempts to get in, the phone
gets wiped
- they just kept copying from the register
after the wipe
  - ROI: $999,990

- Service providers coop w/ LE but don't give
full data

The fourth Amendment states persons be secure
in the persons, houses, papers, and effects
- there is a gray area when it comes to tech
  - do the persons own their data or do the
providers of services own the data?
- does a warrant state electronic communication
devices
  - are flash drives electronic communcation devices?
- restrictions are placed on the government
  - people claim 4th Am. violations and then
freely give information

- private companies are not constrained by the 1, 4 A
  - they can mandate that speech (political, religious,
etc.) are not permitted
  - can run searches on computers they own but
allow employees to use
  - you're an employee and your opinions reflect
the company

- Fourth sets limits on government's rights
to search our homes and business and seize documents
and other personal effects. Requires government
provide probable cause
- 2 problems arise from new technologies
  - much of our personal information is not longer
safe in our homes; it resides on huge databases
outside of our control
  - new tech allows the government to search our
home w/o entering them and search our persons
from a distance w/o our knowledge
- make a possible "noninvasive but deeply revealing"
searches
  - particle sniffers, imaging systems (thermal),
location trackers
- what restrictions should we place on their use?
When should we permit government agencies to use
them w/o a search warrant?
  - in some cases, gov't has deemed LE cannot
use them as the means (thermal imaging, ex.) are
not publically available and LE's use provides them
an unreasonable advantage to gather intel
- Fourth protects tangible things
  - is data tangible? if not, can LE use it

Olmstead vs. United States (1928)
- SC allowed the use of wiretaps on telephone
lines w/o a court order
- interpreted the Fourth to apply only to physical
intrusion and only to the search or seizure of
material things, not conversations

Olmstead reversed w/ Katz vs. United States (1967)
- SC reversed and ruled that Fourth does apply to
conversations
- court said Fourth protects people, not places.
to intrue in a place where a reasonable person
has a reasonable expectation of privacy requires
a court order
- communications as personal property

Do not talk to the police during an investigation
where you are not the obvious victim

Kyllo v US (2001)
- SC ruled that police coudl not user thermal
to search a home from outside w/o a search warrant
- court stated "government uses a device that
is not in general public use, to explore details
of the home that would previously have been
unknowable w/o physical intrusion, the surveillance
is a 'search'"

How should we interpret "plain view" for search
of computer or smartphone files?

Security cameras
- do they increase security?
  - there are regulations on college campuses
- do they decrase privacy?
  - in some countries (e.g., South Korea),
there are cameras everywhere except for inside
bathrooms
  - should this footage be persmissible in court?
  - the view of privacy has changed because
of tech

Should organizers at events which are possible
terrorist targets use such systems?
- I would say there is a general expectation
of safety at such an event. I don't like it,
but it is reasonable

Should we allow them to screen for people
w/ unpaid parking tickets?
- I would so no, that's not the purpose
of the event





  - will state when calls/texts are sent but
won't give any detail, only a time stamp
