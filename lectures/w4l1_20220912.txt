continuing Chpt 2 - Privacy

New tech, new risks

some risks
- information on the Internet seems to last forever
- data collected for one purpose will find other uses
- government can request sensitive personal data held by
businesses and organizations
- we cannot directly protect information about ourselves.
We depend upon businesses and organizations to
protect it.

we often give up a lot of our personal information
w/out knowing what will happen to it onces it's on the web

security vs. privacy - the trade-off

NSA has been collecting intel on Americans online
and phone comms for years

San Diego police now have cameras w/ facial
recognition software to identify detainees
unwilling to give up their identity

"We intimidate you into giving us your information
because we have this computer that will tell us.?

FBI has huge databases to store biometrics
- 370 million fingerprints
- looking to integrate facial biometics
- 160,000 searches a day

fingerprints used to be documented
and searched through by hand

Also adding iris data since it is unique

Anyone could end up being in the database
FBI is being sued to disclose what data
is being stored and how

A number of times, people become suspects
because of innacuracies in the software

Where's the line between safety and spying

1000 cameras in LA to scan faces
up to the minute map of events going on in the city

Opens the possibility of predictive policing

A giant camera on a plane tracks a 25 sq mi
area for up to 6 hrs

Allows for recall of information rather
than only looking at real-time

tested in Philly, Baltimore, Dayton

BIG BROTHER

Allows for an ability to track suspects greater
than traditional policing

No police system has yet purchased the system

The resolution on video is not yet advanced enough to be
admissible in court

WIDE AREA SURVEILLANCE

There are already cameras in every ATM
- most (not all) are already used to being monitored all the time

Where is the line drawn between security and privacy?

The tech was so advanced that things got out of hand

Applications are being expanded greatly...even to fish...
- identifies weaker fish based on physical characteristics

The potato factory in GF used scanning software to scan the
color of the potato to determine the grade of fries

Privacy and civil liberties issues may arise if this
software becomes widely adopted

FindFace app
- scan someone's face to find their social media profile

roughly half of all americans photo id have been cross
checked by the FBI

There are concerns that this tech is being used
to identify BLM protestors
- linked w/ social media profiles
- looked for people w/ outstanding warrants

China can track your movements 1 week back
- knows your license plate, you associates, frequently visited places

China's tracking system is called SKYNET
- Social credit system

The tech is still a work in progress
- in a UK test, only 8/42 identifications were correct

Turns out...facial recognition software troubles
to id black women
...facial software is racist

Amara Majeed was wrongly identified as a terrorist in sri lanka

Are we comfortable w/ this being used even if the software
is perfect?

clearview.ai
hoan ton-that
a search engine for faces based on publically-available
databases that have been scraped
- like, scrapes the whole internet

over 600 le forces have been identified as using the service

companies claim they have a FA right to harvest data

Used by DEA, FBI, Kohl's, Macy's, and Walmart

Ton-That claims he would never sell to NK, China, etc.

But has sold to UAE and Saudi Arabia...quietly

San Francisco banned facial recognition tech by LE
but not other govenrment entities or private companies

IBM is no longer developing
Amazon put a 1 year hold on dev this software

If you were identified as being near the location of a crime,
now you are a person of interest to the police

Or you may be misidentified

The use of tech must be tampered
Are wer really ready as a society to handle the ethical questions
that arise from this tech?

Pew Research indicates that this high-tech is being used to solve
petty crimes
- will tech and analysis be used to solve more intense crime?
- is that not sexy enough?
