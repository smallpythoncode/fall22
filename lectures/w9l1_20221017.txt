Ch 5 - Crime & Security
- Hacking
- Identity Theft and Credit Card Fraud
- Whose laws rule the web

HACKING
- intentional, unauthorized access to computer systems
- the term used to have a positive connotation
  - a "hacker" was a person w/ exceptional programming skill
- there was a time where C was the language that many
students were introduced to
- the term has changed over time
- Phase 1: The joy of programming
  - early 1960s to 70s
  - it was a positive term
  - a "hacker" was a creative programmer who wrote
elegant or clever code
  - a "hack" was an especially clever piece of code

- Who is Dennis Ritchie?
  - died w/in a week of Steve Jobs
- There would be no Steve Jobs w/o Ritchie
- He invented C
  - written as compiling as a primary goal
  - compiler program for OS
  - C can address memory location directly

- In C, it is possible to write working programs
w/ no variables
  - all addresses in memory
  - this elegant technique can be considered "hacking"
in the old sense of the word

Phase 2: 70s to mid 90s
- hacking took on negative connotations
- breaking into computers for which the hacker does not
have authorized access
  - normally not w/ the intent of doing any harm
  - a personal challenge
- still primarily individuals
- includes the spreading of computer worms and viruses
and "phone phreaking"
- companies began using hackers to analyize and improve
security

- George Dubya era
- in NATO, if one nation is attacked, all are attacked
- NATO was asked to respond after 9/11
- an attempt to go into Iraq led many NATO countries
to question if that was related to the 9/11 attacks
- A sense that the US had overstepped its bounds
- this was a factor that lead to the rise of Anonymous
  - hacked into white house website and changed its apperance
  - a political statement
- Anon issued DDOS attacks on the white house

- a website bot was created to search for George Dubya
and then go to website for the definition of "abject failure"
- This traffic pattern influenced Goog's algo to where GW
would be associated with "abject failure" in the searches

- chlorthalidone: his prescription

Phase 3: The growth of the web and mobile devices
- beginning mid 90s
- growth of the web changed hacking; viruses and worms could
be spread rapidly
- political hacking (hacktivism) surfaced
- denial-of-service (DoS) attacks used to shut down websites
  - can be mitigated with tools that can detect potentially harmful
clients and deny the requests from them
- large scale theft of personal and financial info
  - can be used for identity theft or digital robbery

Is "harmless hacking" really harmless?
- responding to non-malicious or prank hacking uses resources
- hackers could accidentally do significant damage
- almost all hacking is a form of trespass

- the system managers don't know the intent of the hack
  - they don't know if the intent is "harmless"
- the same resources must be used to respond to harmless
attacks as those w/ malicious intent
- it advertises the fact that the system has a vulnerability
  - more nefarious uses can then look for was to exploit it
- you have committed a wrong
  - may not be any explicit harm
  - but it makes blurry the line of where
the line is between right and wrong
  - who is to decide what is harmless

There was a UND student who was utilizing a command-line
predecessor to Campus Connection. He mistyped a command
and was given access to an admin-only area. He noticed that
there was a folder for passwords. He notified the admins
notifying them of the vulnerability. The next day
campus police were at his door. 

Why? This was considered trespass. Even though he reported
the vulnerability, he also admitted that he let himself
into an area he was not supposed to be.

What to do? If a vulnerability is identified, don't go snooping.
Identify the point of vulnerability and notify admins of that.
Any access beyond that point is considered trespass.

For government facilities, you have a right to be there.
If there is a door open, you have the right to walk through it
given that there is no postage saying that only authorized personnel
are allowed. This applies to government facilities.

The analogy of physical trespass only goes so far when
comparing that to digital trespass.

Hacktivism, or political hacking
- use of hacking to promote a political cause
- disagreement about whether it is a form of civil
disobedience and how (whether) it should be punished
- some use the apperance of hacktivism to hide
other critical activities
- How do you determine whether something is
hacktivism or simple vandalism?
- when the courts look at a case of hacking into
a system, they in terms of possible punishment
or determination of guilt, they look at
if the intent is vandalism or hacktivism
- if someone in the US were to hack into
an Iranian government facility and discover
information of Iranian government attrocities,
how would a court look at that?
- would it be differnt if a US person
hacked into a US govt system?

HACKERS AS SECURITY RESEARCHERS
- "white hat hackers" use their skills to demonstrate
system vulnerabilities and improve securities
- the Confessions of Marcus Hutchins, the Hacker Who Saved the Internet
  - from Wired
  - https://www.wired.com/story/confessions-marcus-hutchins-hacker-who-saved-the-internet/

- white hats will often accept bouties from companies
who will identify and close vulnerabilities in systems
- black hats use their skills for what is
generally considered evil purposes
- grey hats don't have an allegiance to good or evil

- from wired, at 22 he single-handedly put a stop
to the worst cyberattack the world has ever seen
- then he was arrested by the FBI

Hacking as Foreign Policy
- hacking by governments has increased
- Pentagon has announced it would consider
and treat some cyber attacks as acts of war,
and the US might respond with mil force
- How can we make critical systems safer from attacks?
- establishing programs to test vulnerabilites
(presumably via white hats) before foreign
adversaries consider doing it first
- the Catch Me If You Can guy
introduced the idea of microprint "lines"
on checks
  - microprint of a text

Stuxnet
- An extremely sophisticated worm
- targets a particular type of control system
- the first publically-known major attempt of
a government hacking effort
  - spearheaded by the US
  - coordinated with Israel
- beginning in 2008, damaged equipment in a
uranium enrichment plant in Iran
- Zero Days
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoRoMykmibE
- this hack was so sophisticated and so
costly that investigators came to the conclusion
that only a state would have the resources
to be able to carry it out
- black hats who discover zero days
can make money by selling the intel
on the dark web
  - hundreds of thousands of dollars
- lone wolves can typically only afford
to purchase 1 zero day
  - again, very costly
- Stuxnet (from what is known) targeted
6 zero days
  - costly, indeed
  - possibly over a million dollars
- because of they type of exploits stuxnet
targeted, in order to get the virus to run,
the targeted system had to be convinced
that it was a legitimate piece of code
  - code is legitimized by a certificate
  - OS devs use these to verify third-party code
  - the system that generates certificates
are not connected to the internet
    - obviously, this would be the juiciest of targets
  - private sector "classified"
- in order for stux to work, one of the stand-alone
systems had to be physically access
  - could only have been a government agency
  - eventually revealed that it was collab effort
of NSA, CIA, and Israeli Masad (verify)
- 2010, approx.
- Stuxnet is dormant on millions of computers today
  - can only be detected when it was active on a
system

a zero-day vulnerability is a weakness
in software that has been discovered
by a hacker but is still unknown to the
developer
called "zero-day" because once a hacker
detects the vul, the software vendor
essentially has "zero time" to patch
it before it is exploited
