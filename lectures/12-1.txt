Ch 7 - Evaluation and Controlling Tech

EVALUATION INFO
The need for Reasonable Judgement
- expert info or "wisdome of the crowd"?
  - daunting amount of info on the web,much
of which is incorrect
  - search engines are replacing librarians,
but Web sites are ranked by popularity,
not by expert evaluation
  - Wisdom of the crowd - rating by public
of Web site
  - if millions participate, the results
will be useful

some of the sources on the internet
are not reliable
- misinformation or disinformation
- prior to the internet, availalbe
info was vetted by experts and edited

"private internet" was edited to some degree

A significant number
of the people Musk fired from Twitter
worked on the moderation team

2000 Mules
- D'Souza
- convicted of white collar crime
  - was he?
2000mules.com
  - did d'souza use a deep fake
of Biden?
- are there loops used
in the video surveillance footage?
- how much of this is false?
- wow...john oliver was right about something

1. 
News organizations used to make clear
distrinction between fact and opinion

no clear distinction between
fact and opinion
- opinions often not specified
so audience can take it as fact

mixing fact w/in opinion to make
it seemed more factual

The Need for Responsbile Judgement
- wikipedia
  - written by volunteers, some posts are
biased and not accurate
  - although anyone can write, most
people do not
  - those that typically are educated and experts
- wisdom of the crowd
  - problems of unreliable info are not new
  - the Web magnifies the problems
  - rating systems are easy to manipulate
- vulnerable viewers
  - less educated individuals
  - children

apply critical thinking when
doing research
- verify the sources
- don't treat the words of
authority figures as gospel

- narrowing the information stream

responsible judgement

navigating digital information
better info leads to better decision making
which leads to a better world

take note of content creator's sponsors
- companies typically don't pay people
to make them look bad

There are lies, damn lies, and statistics
- narratives can be twisted to fit a specific
purpose

3 questions professional fact checkers ask
1. who is behind this info?
2. What is the evidence for their claims?
3. What do other sources say about
the org and its claims?

we are inundated w/ info today
it is only to our individual and
collective benefit to fact-check
claims and apply critical
thinking

news has become entertainment
- this is reason enough to
fact-check claims
- if everything is "breaking news",
then is any news really breaking
news?

don't lose sight of the importance
of thinking for yourself
