Just making the development of malware
illegal makes it difficult to counter these

for reverse engineering
- expose and teaching of these in an academic
would also be illegal

Young persons in hacking

of their actions

and those that can turn their skills to more ethical

US publisher, US author
Some people in the UK bought the book
A Saudi man sued the US man through UK courts

Should the blame of libel fall on the author or on a publisher?
Should all 200+ countries' laws be taken into account?

Is there a positive ethical position in circumventing a nation's
censorship laws? Is it okay for the West to provide outside media
to those citizens despite North Korea's strict censorhip
