A Global Workforce
Problems and side effects of offshoring
- consumers complain about customer service
representatives, because accents are difficult
to understand
- employees in the US companies need new job
skills (e.g., managing, working w/
foreign colleagues)
- increased demand for high-skill workers
in other countries forces salaries up

Ethics of hiring foreign workers
- in US, there is a shortage of
tech graduates in the US
- big need for positions of tech to
be filled
  - we have to get them from
somewhere, so we get them from overseas

- people are concerned that
"they're taking our jobs"
- cyber security has a shortage of around
1M personnel
  - there are not enough of these
people coming out of the university
system

Learning About Job Applications
- the Web and social media provide
new means of info collection on job applicants
Employers:
  - search online newsgroups and social
networks
  - hire data-collection agencies
  - use a variety of screening methods to
efficiently reduce a large pool of
applicants to a reasonable number
- some job-seekers attempt to clean up
their online persona

Risks and Rules for Work and Personal
Communications
- employee monitoring is not new
  - employers have always monitored
their employees
  - degree of detail and frequency
of monitoring has varied depending
upon kind of work,
economic factors, and available
technology (time-clocks and logs)
  - early monitoring was mostly
"blue-collar" (factory) and "pink-collar"
(telephone and clerical) jobs
- bosses patrolled the aisles watching
workers
- output counts at the end of the day

UND can only go so far in monitoring
their systems
Not the case in the private sector
- they own the systems so they can
monitor as much as they like

77% of people surveyed say that
they want to continue to work
remotely post covid

employers are attempting to 
enforce employee monitoring software

using employer provided computers
means you are absolutely being monitored

cleaners that access rooms
via biometrics
have their time clocked in the room

Prodoscore, time doctor, transparent business
- employee monitoring services

prodoscore monitors
and transcribes all of your phone calls
- seen by you and your boss
- email productivity scores
- claim that can be used to compare yourself
to other employees
- at the end of the day,
you're being tracked

500% spike for transparent business
since covid pandemic
- doesn't monitor anything until you
clock in
- reports to the cloud rather
than reporting to the office
- it's about consent for this company
  - not being helicoptered at home

An issue w/ remote work tracking
is that they sometimes can't
differentiate between work and
so called "not work"
- just because it can't be tracked
does that mean it's not productive?
- is this really different
than bullshitting in the office?

any job related to creativity
can't really be tracked
- how do you track thinking through
a problem

risks cont'd
separating - or merging - work
and personal communications
- employers often prohibit employees from
using their work email, computers, and other
devices for personal use
- what about employees using personal
email accounts, social media, laptops,
smartphones, and other devices for work?
  - overhead of managing and maintaining
systems to work w/ a variety of brands
and OS
  - security of company info and ops

monitoring employer systems
- roughtly half of major companies in the US
sometimes monitor the email or voice mail
of their employees on company systems
- most companies monitor infrequently,
some routinely intercept all email

audience

3,395 people in UK arrested in 2016
under section 127 of the 2003 Communications
Acts
- "cause annoyance, inconvenience, or needless
anxiety to another"

# this will probably be on final

sustainablity of the internet

Social Sentinel program
University of Virginia

32.3 percent of surveyed institutions
received FIRE's lowest, red light rating
for maintaining speech codes that clearly
and substantially restrict freedom of speech

Social Sentinel
is bascially an algorithm
- what algorithms are perfect?
