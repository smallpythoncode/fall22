Ethics
- The study of what it means to do "the right
  thing"
- assumes people are rational and make free
  choices
- rules to follow in our interaction and our
  actions that affect others
- been questioned by man since the dawn of history
- have been developed and refined over millenia
- do you really have a decision if someone
  threatens you to do something with a gun to
  your head
- "free choice" implies no impeding factor
  to what you desire to do
- ethics can be thought of as princicples
  - may not be explicitly punished if not followed

Two books that illustrate different viewpoints:
- One is Ethics: Discovering Right and Wrong
- Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong

- A variety of ethical views; 3 general theories
  of ethics
  - deontological theories - Immanual Kant
    - everything are absolute; no inflection
      - we should not lie, as example, because
        lying makes to world more difficult to live
      - how to protect yourself agains lying?
        - you could assume he's always lying, but
          then what if he tells the truth?
      - the point of subsequent comms is useless
  - Utilitarianism - John Stuart Mill
    - rules applied in context
    - some rules may be applied on one day
    - different rules on another day
    - considers the consequences of actions
  - Natural rights

- Distinct from natural laws/principles
  - such as physics

- Some view ethics as inventions or made-up rules
  on how to act
  - come from man, not nature
  - "should do's"

1 - Do you eat the dead bodies?
- Do you help the injured or hopeless?
- Do you eat all the food?
- Those that were rescued didn't talk about the
  incident for years
  - The Pope eventually absolved them (they were Catholic)
- deontologically, don't eat the bodies

2 - do you stay with the trailer?
- do you lock the trailer, detach it, and head for shelter?
- was the company in the right in stating the
  driver was to stay with the rig?
- deontly, the man should have stayed and the company
  was in the right
- utilitarianly, obviously the man was right
  to choose his life over the haul

- Airbus software redesign
  - Do you go with whatever management says to
    develop knowing the software may cause
    injury/death
  - catastrophic failure calculations were much
    higher than normal
    - pushed the software regardless in hope
      of fixing before any incident

Do you do what management says if you know it will
cause harm?
- can express concern to management
  - red flag if they say don't consider the ethics
- could walk from the job

Natural law - our right to be able to make decisions
- affected by the influence that may negate that ability

negative rights (liberties)
- the right to act w/o interference
- abortion may fall into this category
  - what is life? where does it begin?
  - does a fetus have rights?
  - is it a religious question? a political one?
- masks (COVID) vs stop signs
  - both for the common good, supposedly
positive rights (claim-rights)
- an obligation of some people to provide
  certain things for others
