skills, labor, non-material efforts and attributes the creator provides

U.S. Copyright Law (Title 17 of U.S. code) gives copyright holder following exclusive rights
- to make copies
- to produce derivative works, such as translations into other languages or movies based on books
- to distribute copies
- to perform the work in public (e.g., music, plays, lectures)
- to display the work in public (e.g., artwork, movies, computer games, video on a web site)
- once something is created, it's copyrighted --> automatic

Challenges of New Technology
- digital tech and the Internet make copyright infringement easier and cheaper
- new compression tech maky copying large files (graphics, video, audio) feasible
- search engines make finding material easier
- peer-to-peer tech makes transferring and sharing files easier

- DVDs were so large that it was once infeasible to copy them on PCs
  - not the case today
  - virutally no limit on storage depending on file size
  - bandwidth has improved, nearly no limit on ability to transfer data, but
may take some time

- broadband connections make transferring files easier and enable streaming of video
- miniturization of cameras and other equipment enable audience members to record and
transmit events
- scanner allow us to change the media of copyrighted work, converting printed tex,
photos, and artwork to electronic form
- new tools allow us to modify graphics, video, and audio files to make derivative works

What does it mean to solve the problems of tech's impact on IP rights?
We should recognize that "the problem" looks different from different perspectives
