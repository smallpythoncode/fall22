FIRST BRIEF
4 technologies from 1.1 and 1.2

today's conversations happen instantly
- text, discord, etc

1. self-driving vehicles
- designed with reduing human-caused traffic accidents
if something goes wrong? who is to blame?

2. Social media
good
- crowdfunding, connecting with family
bad
- cyber bullying, stalking
neutral
- selling of data

3. Artificial intelligence
Turing test - convincing the user it is human
- john Sarrow refutes this concept
  - ai has no idea they are winning
  - just doing what they are told

4. tools for disabled people
- walking paths for the blind
- prostetics to improve walking for disabled peole
what happens if a pace maker gets hacked?

What happens when we all have chips in our heads?
- how much of our day-to-day become obsolete

Keep in the mind the ethics of handing decisions over to technology

SECOND BRIEF
1.3, 1.4
different recurring themes in the book

The internet
- global communication
- law enforcement has become more complex because it's global
- difficult to adapt to new technology

Companies can be slow to adapt to change
- taxis vs Uber

No perfect options
- to tech is w/o it's fault
- what does the law have to say about new tech?
  - can lead to lawsuits

law vs individual choices vs corporate polices
- each distinct
- not every idea is good under the law

1.4 Ethics
- the study of doing the right thing

deontological vs utilitarian
De. (KANT) - rigid and strictly rational
- good because it is rational
  - always wrong to lie
uTILIT. - focused on increasing the happiness of the world as a hold
positive vs negative rights

social contracts
- Hobbs - electing to do something for the common good
- Golden rule

posible third option
- is it "okay"
- neither good nor bad, no harm, no foul

BRIEFING THREE
2.1 2.2

Privacy is of the utmost importance
- free of being observed or disturbed

3 parts of privacy

some limitations
freedom of intrusion
- not 100% anonymous all the time

control of information about oneself
- limited in what we can say
- can't call to act in an illegal way

freedom from surveillance
- hackers can illegal compromise our systems
- stores have cameras if we like them or not

upsides of compromised privacy
phones have evolved with privacy in mind
2-fact authentication to ensure it's you

smart phone apps can (do) track your data
- but you downloaded the app, that's the tradeoff

stolen and lost data
- service provider locks to phone to protect

privacy can become personalized
- businesses track history and usage
  - Amazon provided purchase recommendations

social, individual, and tech considerations of privacy

BRIEF FOUR
2.3, 2.4
PRIVACY in regard to 4th amendment
govt agencies use of tech

targeted ads
companies watch over you
...but so can the government

does the 4th am. protect your tech?

1928
- wire tapping by law was not unconst. because not to the home

1967 reversed
- protects persons, not places

this law does not extend to information we have
freely publicly shared

today's LE uses open source all the time

NSA at one time just kind of ignored the 4A

1978, Foreign Intel Survel Act
- established the bounds of NSA

Edward Snowden leaked the extent the gov.
allegedly goes in collecting on persons
perhaps US persons

=====================

LECTURE

Ch 2 Addresses the issue of privacy
4th Am.
- privacy of self and our effects
- technology upended that

With the state of technology today, it
would not be unreasonable to say that
privacy is dead

taking data from different sources,
analyzing them as a whole, and
the inferences that can be drawn
from that can be a huge threat to privacy

EDWARD SNOWDEN INTERVIEW w/ JOHN OLIVER
June 1, reauthorization of the Patriot Act

Programs
- X key score
- Mystic

section 215, Pat. Act
- pat act written as a response to 9/11
  - gave the govt far reaching privelgest to
collect and means of collect

Was snowden aware of the ramifications of his
actions?

215 was very broad
- can ask for any intangible things if they 
suspect any suspected terrorism

FISA court overseas 215

govt hold phone records but not the calls themselves
- numbers and durations of calls

pat act was routinely reinstated time and time again
- "BTW, patriot act got extended for 4 years..."

we no longer have the luxury of ignorance
of these leaks despite what we think
of how the info was leaked

security vs privacy
- one places restrictions on the other

we spied on unicef according to snowden

did snowden consider the consequences?
