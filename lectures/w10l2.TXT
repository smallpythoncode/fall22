presentation - 8.3

increasing reliability and safety
- risk management
- safety precautions around software dev

software engineering code of ethics

safety critcal applications
- make sure we follow safety guidelines
instead of just having the poster on the
bulletin board

challenger disaster wasn't a computer
error
- humans decided to not head the weather
warnings
- not in line w code of ethics

companies often have risk management
divisions
- exist because they believe
something will eventually will go wrong
- there to be ready to respond

having clear and easy to use
guides and response protocols
can alleviate errors or disaster

a light on the dash where you have no idea
what it means is not very helpful
- how are you supposed to fix something
that you don't know what it is?

autopilot systems are limited
- pilots aren't allowed to just go
to sleep
- they don't need to be on edge for 
8 hours
- but they also need to be aware
and concious enough to respond
to something as it happens

testing
- you need to get out of your own
headspace sometimes
- you may review something
12 times and as soon as you hand
it over to someone else, they find
several errors

independent verification and validation
- giving software to a third-party
for testing
- test in as many way imaginable
(and unimaginable) to try to break the code

some people believe there should be
more laws pertaining to software
development
- similar to prescription drug laws
  - who is accountable? how much can be
given? how much testing is required

presentation - 9.3.11-15

social responsibility

# with all the static, i cannot make
out a single word

keep private matters separate from
business matters
- you are reflection of the company
- don't use company resources for 
personal matters

conflicts of interest

# this guy has trouble clearly stating
his point

# what is a kickback?
- he mentioned it but with the static
it was difficult to glean

it is important for companies to clearly
state their employee/employer relationship
policies so employers don't abuse
employees and employees can express
gratitude to the company if desired

# this dude mumbles a lot...i don't know
what he is saying
- skipping him

presentation - 9.3.6-10

different scenarios and ethics
that apply

ways to address problems
1. let the problems ride and hope
noone notices (bad)
2. bring it up to management and propose
a solution (good)
3. release software early to appease
upper management but with known testing
gaps (bad ethically, but good financially)
4. wait for testing
- good for safety long-term
- not so good short-term because
customers can't get their hands on it
- bad for profit because delays cost dollars

a lot of this boils down to safety and
accuracy vs profit and self-interest,
i.e., keeping your job

===============

presentation - 9.3.1-5

it is difficult for humans to temporarily
set aside their biases to wholly analyze
the good and bad outcomes of good
and bad methods of handling problems

is it honest, responsible?
does it violate an agreement?

brainstorm and analysis phase

who is affected? who gets benefits?
what are avenues of approach?

analysis phase
identify whose decision it is to make
who are the stakeholders

designing an application w/ targeted
ads

app has user share some of their data
and gives option to send links
to stories to their friends
- privacy policy should outline
what information is used
- ads that can be traced back to a
user operations should
be outlined in the policy
- people don't read terms
and conditions most of the time
  - signing a legal document
w/out reading it

should the data not be stored?

- how long data is stored, how
it is used, how is it distributed,
the whole 9

- should offer an opt-out version
for random ads (not personalized)
- increases privacy and
good faith to customers
- can offer premium version
of app to not offer ads at all

publishing security vulnerabilities
MIT was going to talk about vuls in
boston transport networks
- network management takes issue
w/ this and gets judge to order
that presentation not be made to public
the students suggest publishing
it to the internet and share
the idea w/ you
- what do you do?
