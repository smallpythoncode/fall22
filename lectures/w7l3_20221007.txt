Employers monitoring employees in and out of workplace

Employee monitoring has evolved over time
- supervisors ensure the employees are doing
their jobs

The digital age - a device on every person
- changes the way employers can monitor what
the person does and thinks
- employers screen people's online content
- implicit bias can affect one's ability to be hired
  - even for something innocuous

People can clear out soc med to be more
attractive to employers

2 resumes
- the resume handed to the employers
- soc med profile

Is it ethical for employers to have access
to so much knowledge of who a person is?
- for good or bad
- weeds out bad but a privacy concern on the good

even after hiring, you're still subject to monitoring

if you "like" content from a competitor, your employer
may take issue to that

if you're going through a family crisis, how much of a
right does an employer have to know?

employers have an interest in their employees soc med
presence as it reflects on the company

If employer resources (bandwidth, time) are used
for personal reasons (watching a YT video), should
an employer discipline employees for it?

Before, the supervisor had to be somewhere
In the digital age, any number of computers can
be monitored remotely
- emails can be monitored
- criticism is not private

The capability to monitor employees is huge

Evaluating the info available online

responsible judgement and computer models

huge amounts of information are fictitious
pictures can be faked

how do we id manipulative information?

wikipedia is a classic example of disinformation

the wisdom of the crowd
- forums
- often not subject matter experts

narrowing of info stream
- algos feed you information you are likely 
to agree w/
- selectively reading only what one agrees with
idealogically

use of computer models to decide outcomes
- predict future events
- not perfect, sometimes mistaken

abdacating responsiblity
- consulting a computer model
- accepts whatever decision the model "makes"
- doctors, truck drivers
- airplanes can crash
- people committed for crimes they did not make

predicting the future
- complicated
- climate change, population growth
- can have political bias built in
- often not fully understood
  - who actually reads the code/formula/model?

Neo-luddites - oppose many forms of modern technology
- tech/comps are reason why society is going south
- cause unemployment
- social inequity
- weaken communities
- nothing to solve real human problems
- environmental concerns

opposition: enables online enrollment at UND

Kirk Patrick Sale
two moral judgments against computers
- enable pernicious caplitalist goals to be pursued
more swiftly
- forces are destroying nature with more efficiency

dislike business, factories, cities, modern transport

is this tech needed or not needed?
- is it good or bad?
- is it really black and white?

Is what we are creating tech-wise more good than bad?
- amazon has revolutionized retail
  - convenient but at what cost?
  - hurts small business but helped during COVID

Nature
- neo-luddites ask are smartphones or needs?
- a lot of time wasted onlines and on phones

tech has benefitted medicine
- 1900 47 avg years
- 2016 94 avg year life span

Large insurance company saved 100M
pages of manuals in 9 months by storing
them digitally

main point: Is the tech necessary? Move us forward
or back?

Discussion between US and developing countries
- what is line between affluence and poverty?
- Those who do not have access to digital tech
(by their discussion definition) live in poverty

1990 - PC 10% of household income, it cost
internet was stupid slow
- required technical skill
- only 22% of households owned the computers
- limited access in schools

by 2000, 98% of school had internet access
- most public locations have internet acces
- government invested billions in internet infrastructure

2015 - 92% of adults had a wireless device
67% had a smartphone

reaching the next billion users
- to help people get access to internet
in developing countries
- 50% of users have access in the countries
  - large scale view
  - 87% in dense areas
  - as little as 10% in sparse areas
- helps medical problems, education opportunities
to help these areas prosper

can't forget the base requirement of power
- approx 1 billion people don't live in electric
accessible places

dev country schools are working to provide
cheap ($200) laptops to elementary schools
- designed to work in extreme cultures, such as hot

Mobile phones enhance women's views of equality
- job opportunities
- independence

How important is this tech in poor countries?
- is it healthcare problem? financial? educational?
- internet access may alleviate all of these considerations
  - establish connections w/ users in developed countries

Presentation - 6.1, 6.2

advancement of tech and replacement of jobs

computers are advancing, but not so advanced
to take everyone's jobs...yet
- some are being replaced right now
- on the flip side, new jobs are being created
  - software devs, maintenance

worrying about tech replacing jobs
- as old as industrial revolution
- people fear the unknown
  - what jobs were replaced by steel proliferation?

Jobs difficult to replace now
- nursing
- bank tellers
- accountants
- people still want the human connection for these jobs

Advancing tech may replace some jobs, but the
maintenance of the new tech (and dev) creates new jobs

New industries were created because of tech
- social media influencer
- affiliate marketing
- social media platform engineers

good: removes child labor

1993-2002 309.9 million job titles were eliminated
327.7 job titles were created

Buruea of Labor Stats
- auditing jobs, comp sci, are expected to grow
- manufacturing jobs are expected to decrease

Cuomo: NYU professor fired for making class to hard

organic chemistry teach had a petition against him
students claimed that high standards was direct cause
of low test scores

30th math, 19th in science for US

only 11% of Americans have STEM degrees

Should we let students set that standards for grading?
- this is an opinion piece

Maitland Jones
82 of 350 of his students said the course was too difficult
org chem is legendarily hard
- weeds out a lot of students
- if you can be failed, you should be failed

Is college these day a place where you receive an
education or simply a credential?

NY Times quoted Jones
"They weren't coming to class, that's for sure,
because I can count the house...They weren't watching the
videos, and they weren't able to answer questions."

Learning in a virtual environment can be more difficult
than in a classroom environment

A number of students who signed the petition were
surprised that he got fired

Dean of science stated
"...did not rise to the standards we require
from our teaching faculty"
Jones wrote a textbook on org chem

This person was well established
famous in his field

on the other hand, he was somewhat condescending
- thought little of his students

students didn't expect him to be fired, they wanted
a dialogue to be opened between him and the admin
- address his attitude
