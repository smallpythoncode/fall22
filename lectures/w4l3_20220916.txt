Presentation - Ch 4.5, 4.6
Free stuff on the internet
Ethics of free software
- open source
- has many advantages over closed-source
  - can be adopted for specifice uses w/
limited resources (time, investment)

copyleft
- free use of modification, but
any derivative software, i.e., implements
use of software in source, must also
carry the same license

how will software be developed if
no one is getting paid?

often kept alive by donations

will not replace the need of propriety

software cannot be patented because it
is abstract, but hardware that uses it
can be

Should Barnes & Noble's one-click buy
patent have been approved at all?

useful, complete, or tangible result
SC guideline if patent can be allowed

patent abuse has become more common in recent
years
- limits innovation
- not impossible to tip-toe around

good and bad w/ software patenting


Presentation - Ch 3.6, 3.7
the role in internet in freedom of speech
China, Saudia Arabia has heavy restrictions
in order to protect their power

many companies will change their operating
procedures and content in order to be
accepted in the huge chinese market

censorship right under our noses in the west

government has attempted to shut down
messaging apps in the name of "safety"
at certain times

Net Neutrality
universal quality and access to the interet

opposition propose tiered access
the higher the tier, the better the web experience

isn't money a reasonable barrier to quality
of access to the interet?

Presentation - Ch 4.1, 4.2

Intellectual property is a work or
invention that can apply for rights

copyright - legal rights to a certain property
patent - protect inventions from knock offs
and copy cats

the buyer purchases certain rights
buyer may resell a book, but cannot make copies
for profit
- can for education w/in reason

limited right time for books
- lifetime plus 70 years

exact replicas are more easily created now
than in previous eras

not being able to afford a copyrighted work
is not a defense against acquiring it by other means

Beta Max allowed the recording of TV
is this on Sony or the customer?
SC ruled that is is okay for fair use

Nintendo - copying of games
for reverse engineering is legal
Apple - cut and paste is so common
in computers that these features
have no rights


Presentation - 4.3, 4.4

industry vs copyright infringement

copy protection mechanisms
dongles, expiration dates, special
serial numbers for activation

hackers don't care
these mechanisms are clunky
and not user friendly

"software police" would raid places
that pirate digital content

entertainment companies would litigate
against people who make copies

DIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT
- limits free use
- allows the company to tailor how
their content can be used

DIGITAL MILLENIUM COPYRIGHT ACT
- bans the sharing of DRM circumvention tools
- safeharbor provisions protects platforms
from litigation if they put in reasonable
measures to protect the copyright owners
content from piracy

Search engines and online libaries

search engines on the surface fit fair
use guidelines but they also make money
from ads on just snippets of content

Author's Guild et al vs Google
- judged ruled this fair use
- turns books into something new and
valuable society
- deemed to be free content
- author's guild argued that the
amount of content was excessive
and the judge's definition of
fair use was unprecedented


Presentation - 2.6, 2.7
protection of privacy rights

up until late 19 century, there
were sparse laws on privacy

1890, the right of privacy
samual warren article argued
for the need for privacy of
for citizens

targeted newspapers for publishing
personal details and opinions
on social standing

the calls for privacy in this manner
seemed very broad and seems to be
in opposition of freedom of the press

the amount of personal information
stored today is mind-blowing
- how does this impact privacy today

confidentiality agreements

privacy regulations in the EU 2.7
- directive regulates how data
is stored, distributed, and used
- 1995

US companies make money from harvesting
personal data and lobby the government
for their right to do so


==============================
Ch 2 wrap up

National ID systems
- Social security numbers
  - too widely used
    - too widely, perhaps. old numbers
from deceased persons have been reused
  - easy to falsify
  - was not created to identify persons
- various new proposals would require
citizenship, employment, health, tax,
financial, or other data, as well as biometric
information. In many proposals, the cards
would also access a variety of databases
for additional info

New system pros
- would require the card
- harder to forge
- have to carry only one card
cons
- threat to freedom and privacy
- increased potential for abuse

PROTECTING PRIVACY
tech and markets
- privacy enhancing-techs for consumers
  - WhatsApp provides end to end encryption
  - FB claims it's using info for performance
metrics, not collection of personal data
- encryption
  - public-key cryptography
- business tools and policies for protecting
data

encryption policy
- government ban on export of strong
encryption software in the 90s (removed in
the 2000s)

rights and laws
- Warren and Brandeis: in involate privacy
- Judith Jarvis Thomson: Is there a right to privacy?
  - how is this defined today in terms of tech

- transactions
- ownership of personal data
- a basic legal framework: enformcement of
agreements and contracts
  - NDA are implemented to protect
copyright information
- regulations

Harley Davidson tried to trademark
the sound of their engines
- denied because the engine
was not created for the purpose of making
that sound

Rights and Law: contrasting viewpoints

free market view
- freedom of consumers to make voluntary
agreements
- diversity of individual tastes and values
- response of the market to consumer prefernces
- usefulness of contracts
- flaws of regulatory solutions

consumer protection view
- uses of personal info
- costly and disruptive results of errors
in databases
- ease w/ which personal info leaks
out
- consumers need protection from their
own lack of knowledge, judgment, or
interest
- regulations have come into being
in the name of protection that
mandate a disclaimer be made
on how companies use the data

How would the free market view and the
consumer protection view differ on errors
in Credit Bereau databases?

Who is the consumer in this situation?
