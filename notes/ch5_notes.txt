ERAS OF HACKING
1. 60s, 70s - hacking was a positive term
2. late 70s to late 90s, hacking took on more negative
meanins
3. late 90s to today - explosion due to advancing tech
- access to the Web, e-commerce, number of devices connected

Era 1 - The joy of programming
- a "hacker" was a creative programmer who wrote
very elegant or clever programs
- unauthorized access happend, but typically was not
the goal
- early hackers sought knowledge and intellectual
challenges
- usually done on a single computer or in a small network

From the New Hacker's Dictionary
- a hacker is a person who enjoys exploring the details
of programmable systems and how to stretch their
capes
- one who programs enthusiastically (even obsessively)

hacking for Jude Milhon
- clever circumvention of imposed limits

Era 2 - the rise of hacking's dark side
- dawn of viruses
- pranks
- digital vandalism
- harassment
- theft

Rose to the common meaning of today
- breaking into computer systems for which the hacker
does not have authorized access

Read book - The Cuckoo's Egg

The 1988 Morris Worm led to the creation of the 
Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center
- affected thousands of computers, most of the internet
at that time
- created by grad student at Cornell University

Era 3 - Hacking as a destructive and criminal tool
- critical infrastructure is connected to the internet
  - prime targets for hackers

Interesting viruses
- Melissa
- Love Bug / ILOVEYOU
  - estimated $10M in damage

Remember George Hotz?

5.2.2 HACKER TOOLS

Virus - software that attaches or adds itself to
other software. Small portion of program
that can replicate itself and perform other functions.
Often spread when someone runs an infected program
or opensan infected attachment.

Worm - Similar to a virus
- doesn't need to attache itself to another program
- designed to exploit specific system flaws
- scans nearby systems for similar flaws and spreads
to them
- Conficker worm shipped with police body cams
in 2015

Trojan horse - appears benign but carries a malicious
componenet
- runs the intended func w/ malicious componenets
in the background

social engineering - the manipulation fo people into
releasing info or performing a task that violates
security protocols
  - impersonation as customer or tech support

phishing
- smishming via text (SMS)
- sending millions of messages fishing for
info to use to impersonate someone
and steal money or goods
- spear phishing atims at high-level corporate or gov
employees

pharming - luring people to fake websites where
thieves collect personal data

Ransomware

Spyware
- Cassidy Wolf

Botnet - gropu fo computers or other devices on the
web that have a virus or piece of malware that
comms w/ a centrol host or server controlled by
a hacker
- coordinated army of compromised devices
  - Sean Gallagher
- server can tell bots/zombies to send spam, malware,
initiate distributed denial of service attacks
- Conficker, Zeus, Simda

DoS or DDoS - attack in which a botnet overwhelms websites,
mail servers, or other locations w/ so many requests
for service that normal users can't access the sites
or service
- can crash sites/services
- Mirai, 2016

Backdoor - software that allows access to a computer
system or device at a future time by bypassing
the normal layers of security
- can be written into the code so system can be accessed
at a later date

development of malware requires skill.
implementation doesn't. malware can be acquired
on the net for free or for very low cost.

5.2.3. Is "Harmless" Hacking Harmless?
Some claim if no data is copied and no files
are changed then the hack is harmless

Responding to nonmalicious intrusions requires
the same resources as responding to potentially
malicious ones

Even if nothing is changed or copied, sensitive personal
data may be exposed

Another danger of "harmless" hacking is that something
may have been changed by accident

5.3 SOME SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS OF HACKING
5.3.1 Identify Theft

Our identity has become a series of numbers
- phone, SSN, accounts, etc

cybersecurity breaches is not just a direct
cost to the organizations breached
- indirect costs to consumers via higher
prices to pay for new infrastructure, hiring
of cybersec personnel, investigations
- individual victims can have their
credit scores affected
- identity and financial information stolen

Job-hunting sites are a treasure trove
for identity thieves
- work histories, birth dates, other details
of a person's life
- can post fake jobs and ask for more info
stating that the info is part of a background
check

5.3.2 Target breach, 2013
40M credit card nums, 70M names, address, and phone nums
- hackers sent phishing email to employee at
Fazio Mechanical
- employee clicked on attachment/link and
inadvertently installed Citadel Trojan
  - steals usernames and passwords
- Fazio employees connected to at least
2 different internal Target apps for electronic
billand and contract submission

cyber investigators discovered that
Target servers used default or weak passwords

BlackPOS captured cardholder data in the
short window during the transaction
when it was unencrypted
- hackers then set up their own server to
retrieve the data and send it off

- estimated take from this hack
was $53.7M
- Target saw 46% drop in profits for the quarter
compared to the previous year
- banks and credit unions spent and estimated
$200M to reissue credit cards for about half
of the compromised accounts

5.3.3 Hacktivism, or Political Hacking
- use of hacking to promote a political cause

- those who agree w/ the movement tend to view
it as activism
- those who oppose view it as crime, maybe
even terrorism

- are these legitimate protests? or is it
some kid on his laptop showing off?

- to activists, it's sticking it to the man
and defensible
- to customers and owners, it's vandalism,
trespassing, and theft

It's difficult to develop sound ethical basis
if one is planted on one end of the political
spectrum and views the act through
that lens

- is it civil disobedience?
- is it more justified than criminal hacking?

protesting outside of an abortion clinic
is much different than burning it down
- peaceful resistance vs trespassing and vandalism

Is it freedom of speech?
- FA doesn't protect you hanging signs on someone
else's fence
- have the freedom to speak but not the right
to compel others to listen

5.3.4 Hacking by Governments
- for economic and military espionage and to
disable current or future enemies

The Pentagon announced that the US will treat some
cyberattacks as acts of war and may respond w/
military force

5.4 WHY IS THE DIGITAL WORLD SO VULNERABLE?
factors contributing to vulnerabilities and weaknesses
- inherent complexity of computer systems
- dev history of the Internet and the Web
- software and comms systems that govern
industrial and comms infrastructure
- speed at which new apps develop
- economic, business, and political factors
- human nature

Every digital device or system almost certainly has
flaws or weaknesses that can be exploited

5.4.1 Vulnerability of Operating Systems and the Internet
- Some OS companies push OS updates w/out the user's consent
  - they value security over the customers' prefences
  - some customers object; "not what I paid for"
- IT companies protested because updates were not
compatible with certain applications
- most software companies now make updates optional for
users
  - this leads to a patchwork of updates for computers,
sometimes on the same network

Because of the dynamic environment of updates vs
security threats, a system that was at one point
secure may become vulnerable later.

the early Internet was not concerned w/ passwords
- they did not conceive that someone would intentionally
try to destroy the system
- use was based on trust

Dan Farmer ran a program to probe the booming
90s internet to detect sites w/ potential
security concerns
- of the 1700 examined, 2/3 had weaknesses
- only 4 apparently noticed that it was being probed
- banks, newspapers, govt agencies

many small businesses do not have a dedicated IT dept
- they may not even be able to afford a single person
- training is often limited
- little experience or technical knowledge of such matters

small-time websites are prime targets for hackers
- the low security makes them easy to infiltrate
- can be used to mimic bank sites
- can host phishing scams and distribute malicious
code
- can act as a C2 server for a botnet

The heartbleed bug
OpenSSL - library of computer code the programmers
use to send and receive encrypted messages
- estimated 2/3 of internet relied on this
for security
- 2014 a catastrophic bug found taht made it possible
to see the information unencrypted
- present in versions of OpenSSL since 2012
  - potentially 2 years of exposure

- nonprofit managed OpenSSL and received $2K in
donations annually
- bug was simple programming error of part-time contributor
- Linux Foundation evenutally upped their donations
to the organization

5.4.2 Human Nature, Markets, and Vulnerability of the Internet
of Things

The demands of the market often lead to developers
and producers of new tech pushing product out the door
w/o mitigating sec concerns
- eventually learned form lessons
  - biometric locks
  - cables for locking laptops
  - better training for employees who operate
hand helds

5.5 SECURITY

5.5.1 Tools to Help Protect the Digital World
Retail merchants consider some loss as just a part
of doing business

smart-card chip provides better authentication
of credit cards
- thieves cannot clone the chip info to fake
cards as they could have w/ magnetic strips

PayPal provides security and peach of mind
by being a third party
- can buy from strangers online w/out
having to give them a credit card number

near-field communication (NFC) allows people
to pay w/ their phones by passing it near
a terminal
- creates an encrypted transaction record
that is unique for that purchase

ENCRYPTION
core Internet comms protocol TCP/IP
does not encrypt data because of large
amounts of computing power

because of the cost to develop, implement,
and operate, encryption services on the internet
sometimes cut corners

encryption is also used for stored data and documents

Anti-malware software and trusted applications

2 techniques for searching for malware
1. anti-malware looks at or scans all the files
on the device input into the computer
- can set software to periodically scan files
on computer
- searches through code in the files looking for
signatures
  - sequences of chars that match those
known from viruses stored in a database
- notifies you if one is found and places it
in quarantine
- can simply deleting the quarantine remove
the virus?

Occasionally a piece of malware can make
it pas the scan undetected
2. monitor a computer system for
"virus-like" activities
- modding parts of memory outside the
area a program is permitted to
- launching or modding multiple
programs simultaneously

- notifies the user and shuts down the
program is initiating the activites

Most OS manufacturers grant option
to users to only allow software
from a certified dev
- digital certificate

Authenticating websites pg 300
- the images some websites use
as authentication mechs are to indicate
to the user the that the site is
legit

Authenitcating users pg 300

Biometrics pg 301
- finger prints
- voice prints
- hand geometry
- eye (iris or retina) patterns
- DNA

Multifactor authentication 303
3 cats
1. something you know - password, PIN, passphrase
2. something you are - voiceprint, fingerprint, eye scan
3. something you have - debit/credit card, smartphone, fob
- for best security, have at least 2 cats each from
different categories

5.5.2 People Who Can Help Protect the Digital World
pg 304

cybersecurity specialists
can belong to:
- IT department of org
- independent sec co
- academia
- govt

activites lie in 3 broad areas:
1. protecting systems and networks
2. testing the security of existing systems
and networks
3. investigating sec breaches

their 3 goals
- include preventing unauthorized access

1. confidentiality
- ensuring data that should be private remains private
2. integrity
- ensuring data are not changed w/o authorization and are
consistent over time and in sync w/ the real word
3. availability
- ensuring the system, services, and data are accessible
when needed

a balancing act
- a system that noone can access is very secure,
but it is then not very useful

frequently, investigators can ID hackers
because they brag about their
exploits

Decision makers in businesses, orgs, and govt pg 305

Software designers, programmers, and system admins pg 306

Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) dev'd
coding standards for secure software development
that schools should teach software devs from
their first intro to programming

system admins have a professional, ethical,
and often legal obligation
to take reasonable sec measures to protect
their systems.
they must anticiapte risks, prepare for them,
and stay up to date about new risks
and new sec measures.

Users pg 306

password practices
1. choose strong passwords
2. change passwords periodically
3. do not use the same
password for multiple purposes

# pg 307
"some businesses have hundreds of thousands..."s

A good cybersecurity program educats employees about
cyber risks and the role each playes
in the org's sec
- actually provides training

Physical sec
- unlikely issue given that people have to
physically be somewhere to steal digital
data, but it's very real

5.5.3 HACKING TO IMPROVE SECURITY

Penetration testing
pen testing firms are typically held to NDAs
- to disclose to anyone besides the
org's sec team is a grave breach of professional
ethics

pen testing is a valuable part of training
for cyber security professionals
- to defeat a hacker, you need to think like
one

Responsible disclosure pg 309

subculture of hackers who, w/o permission,
probe computer systems as an intellectual
exercise to find sec flaws
- gray hats
- key ethical challenge: how do they disclose
vulnerabilities to warn potential victims
w/ou informing malicious hackers?

it is responsible practice to disclose the flaw
privately to the org so that it has time
to prepare patches before a bad guy discovers
it

Dan Kaminsky discovered a major flaw in the domain
name server system (domain to IP address system)
- worked in secret w/ several companies
- told them he would release the information
to the public in 30 days
- this lit a fire under everyone's asses to
get a patch implemented

Google does something similar w/ websites
w/ clear sec flaws
- gives 90 days

Is this time frame good enough?
- will rushing a patch create more issues?

Major tech companies offer bounties
to people for privately discovering vulnerabilites
in their software

Some business and govt agencies have so
much confidence in their systems that
they refuse to believe anyone can
break in

Nearly all hacking (even for good intent)
is condsidered illegal these days

5.5.4 BACKDOORS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT

FBI and other agencies pushed for backdoors into
comms equipment so they coud access communications
Congress passed the Comms Assistance for Law
Enforcement Act (CALEA) in 1994
- the law requires that the design of telecomms
equipment ensures that gov can intercept
telephone calls (w/ a court order or other
authorization)

Any backdoor increases vulnerability
- hackers, criminals, foreign govt's

- trying to implement similar backdoors
for decryption
- congress did not pass

The backdoor controversy revived pg 312
companies began dev encryption so strong
and privacy based that even the companies
themselves couldn't access the data

Apple refused to cooperate w/ FBI
on 2015 San Bernadino investigation
- data erasure after 10 failed attempts
to unlock

5.6 THE LAW
5.6.1 THE COMPUTER FRAUD AND ABUSE ACT
- passed in th 80s
- covers govt computers, finacial systems,
and computers used in interstate and
international commerce or comms
  - i.e., all of the internet
- illegal to access such a device w/o
authorization or to exceed
on'es authorizaation, and read or copy
info

USA PATRIOT Act amended the CFAA
- increased penalties for a first
offense and for hacking
computers used by the criminal justice
system or the military
- permits the gov to monitor online
activity of suspected hackers w/o
a court order
- definition of hacking under
pat act is broad

unintended applications pg 314

unclear definitions for "without
authorization" and "exceeding authorization"

Lori Drew - MySpace cunt

Aaron Swartz - downloaded a shit ton
of papers from MIT
- he justified it by saying many
of them were develped using government grants
- the charges brought against him
eventually led him to suicide

5.6.2 Criminalize Virus Writing and Hacker
Tools? pg 316

5.6.3 Penalties for Young Hackers pg 316

Richard Feynman found or guessed the codes
to the safes containing classified documents
w/ data on the development of the 
atomic bomb
- he left notes inside sayin that the
security wasn't as good as they thought

Parents of young hackers often have
no idea what their sons are doing
at the keyboard

5.7 Whose Laws Rule the Web?
pg 319
5.7.1 A Crime in One Country but Not Another

the Filipino man who created the ILOVEYOU
virus remained a free man because there was no
law on the books in the Philippines at the
time for what he did

subject areas where national laws differ
- content control/censorship
- intellectual property
- gambling
- hacking/viruses
- libel
- privacy
- commerce
- spam

5.7.2 Libel and Freedom of Speech
Differences amoung free countries pg 3.2.2

libel - written defamation
slander - verbal defamation

In the US, if the content is true,
it is not considered libel

English and Austrailian laws and tradition
places more emphasis on protectinggit push origin master
reputation
- michael jackson won a libel suit
against a british newspaper who commented
on this plastic surgery

In the US, the burden of proof is on
the person suing
- he must prove the published info
is false AND that the publisher knew
it was false or acted recklessly

libel tourism in England is an
effect of the relative ease w/
which people can win suits there
