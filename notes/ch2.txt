3 aspects of privacy:
1. Freedom from intrusion
2. Control of information about oneself
3. Freedom from surveillance

Privacy threats:
- Intentional, institutional uses of personal info
- Unauthorized use or release by "insiders"
- Theft of info
- Inadvertant leakage of info through negligence or carelessness
- Our own actions

Just assume that every action taken online is logged
- some gets stolen
- some gets sold

Informed consent - when a business or organization informs
people about its data collection and use policies or about
the data that a particular device or app collects

opt in / opt out
- The two most common forms of giving people some control over
secondary uses of info

Opt-out - One must check a box on an agreement or contact
the organization to request that the organization not use
one's info in a particular way

Opt-in - the collector of the info may not use it for certain
secondary uses unless the purpose explicitly permits it

Data mining - searching and anlyzing masses of data to find patterns and
develop new information or knowledge

Matching - combining and comparing info from different
databases
  - often using identifiers such as SSN or IP Addresses

Profiling - analyzing data to determine characteristics of people most
likley to engage in certain behaviour

Fair Information Principles/Practices
- ethical guidelines for protection of personal data
- wide variation in interpretation, however

- inform people on when info is collected, what is collected,
how it is used
- collect only data needed
- offer opt out methods
- keep data only as long as needed
- maintain accuracy of data
- Secure the data
- develop and publish policies for responding to law
enforcement requests for data

2.2.1
One argument for the tracking of online data for online marketing
purposes is that it allows customers to see only ads they have
a potential interest in, rather than ones the potential customer
and has zero interest in
- more pleasing to the customer
- let's face it, ads are not going away
- Google claims to display not untargeted ads



2.2.4
The right to have material removed, as a legal or ethical right,
has come to be called a "right to be forgotten"

2.3.1 - The Fourth Amendment
"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,
papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures,
shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable
cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing
the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."

William Pitt in 1763 --> "...but the King of England cannot enter."

2.4.1 - Video Surveillance and Face Recognition



2.4.2 - Databases
Provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974
- Restricts the data in federal government records to what is
"relevant and necessary" to the legal purpose for which
the government collects it
- requires fed agencies to publish a notice of their record
systems in the Federal Register so that the public may
learn about what databases exist
- Allows people to access their records and correct
inaccurate info
- requires procedures to protect the security of the info in the databases
- prohibits disclosure of info about a person w/o his or her consent

The Government Accountability Office has reported
that several 3 letter gov agencies and the White House
did not comply with the standards for protecting
info in databases

2.4.4 National ID Systems
The use of SSN are so widespread these days
that they can hardly be called an effective
means of identification
- use of the card in so many databases makes
them less secure
- goes against the original purpose of the number

2.4.5 The NSA and Secret Intel Gathering
The Foreign Intel Surveillance Court is the secret
court that issues warrants for the NSA to use to monitor
US persons clandestinely associated w/ foreign powers
or terrorists

2.5.1 Developing Privacy Tools



2.5.3 Blocking Ads
In John Rawl's view, an action is not ethical if it has the effect
of leaving the least advantaged people worse off


2.5.4 Policies for Protecting Personal Data




2.6.1 A Right to Privacy
Until the late 19 century, there was no recognition
of an independent right to privacy.

In 1890, Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis published an
article called "The Right to Privacy"
- argued that privacy is distinct from other rights
and needs more protection

Judity Jarvis Thomson held the opposite view of
Warren and Brandeis

Judge Richard Posner gives economic arguments about how
to allocate property rights to info

2.6.2 Law and Regulation

2.6.3
Free market view
- subscribed to by people who prefer market-oriented solutions
for privacy problems tend to empahsize:
  - freedom of individuals to make voluntary agreements
  - diversity of individual tastes and values
  - flexibility of technological and market solutions
  - response of markets to consumer preferences
  - usefulness and importance of contracts
  - flaws of detailed or restrictive legilation and regulatory solutions

Advocates emphasize the distinction between the role
of ethics and the role of law

Views privacy as a "good"
- desirable
- something that can be obtained in varying amounts
in the "economy"
  - similar to safety, a minimum can be prescribed by law,
but beyond that a menu of options should be allowed to be
made available

Consumer protection view
- argue for mor stringent consent requirements, legal restrictions
on consumer profiling, porhibitions of certain types of contracts
or agreements to disclose data, and prohibitions
on businesses collecting or storing certain kinds of data
- fans of opt in policies as opt out policies and procedures
are often obscured

Fuck Mary Gardiner Jones

Views privacy as a right rather than a bartering tool
